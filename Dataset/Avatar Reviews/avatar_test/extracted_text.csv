0,"I suppose it's possible to like a movie but disike the storyline, right? Visuals were
epic, as expected. I felt very let down by the storyline - American army man wants
revenge so bad he travels back to this other universe for a second time to try and
kill one man/blue. I couldn't do better myself but that's not my job, thankfully,
because it must be very hard to think of a new concept for a second movie. Its like
they used the story from the first Avatar and tweeked a few things, added some
really big names to the cast, put them in water instead of trees and there you have
it. I know its fiction but that mission would never be approved because of the
astronomical cost and the cause. like, get over it dude. Fragile masculinity.

1,"The sensible thing to do would have been to save his memory after he's already
been told this, so that when the avatar/clone wakes up it would already know
what's happened and wouldn't go on a confused rampage,

2,"The special effects in this movie are absolutely stunning and the underwater elements
are beautiful and very well done. The characters, both known and new, are fascinating
and very entertaining. From a storyline standpoint, this might not be as good as the first
film, and there's an overuse of the children for cause-and-effect moments, but it is still
science fiction gold and worthwhile. I always adore how these movies highlight the
impact of colonialism on culture, nature and the indigenous people. The action scenes are
out of this world, whether it is action in nature or the more traditional shootouts,
explosion and hand to hand combat. Everything about this picture is fun.

Overall, this was worth the wait, a science fiction masterpiece that's an absolute must
see. I would score this a 9/10 and strongly recommend

3,"To say I'm disappointed is an understatement. This should have been much better than it
was. This was basically a rehash of the first movie's plot with added family drama and a
switcheroo of who was becoming an avatar.

4,"The special effects are very impressive, but the film very slowly becomes a remake
of the first film, only set on the coast rather than in the forest. Does anyone care?
Is there anything to be gained that wouldn't be from watching the first film again?

6,"Cannot wait till the next movie is out. This will for sure break all the records. The
Academy should recognize all the efforts put into making this movie. It's good that they
took all the time they needed to make it. It gave us the right time to warch this movie
with the mind blowing experience.
",positive
7,"It's worth seeing in the theaters for the visual experience alone, but I'm disappointed
because I expected so much more from a master like James Cameron. I was so bored
and had such little investment in the characters by the third act that I actually found

myself laughing at moments that were supposed to be heartfelt, (""Noooo! She was my
soul sister!"")
",positive
8,"Opulent, technically brilliant, even perfect form has completely overpowered the
essential, and that is the film. It's like staring at a perfect video game played by someone
else. At first you are amazed by the perfect graphics, you want to play too, but you can't
and then you just stare blankly. The action scenes are absolutely horrible. God, Water
World with Kevin Costner was incomparably better than this. I expected it to be nothing
much, but I never thought it would be so shocking. What on earth were they doing for 13
years? Disastrous music, terrible finale, non-existent script, extremely unlikeable
characters, endless length. Boring, boring, boring and just boring.
",negative
9,"James Cameron holds no punches in Avatar: The Way of Water, testing our characters to
greater limits and how much we can see ourselves reflected in this epic tale of cultural
identity and mother nature. This movie has a special place in my heart not solely because
of the technological evolution on display, but because this is modern myth-making at its
finest. I'm not going to go on a hyperbolic word spree but it was phenomenal. The best
action paired with the best visuals I've seen in years. An amazing journey. The 3 hours
flew by. I loved it and I can't wait to see it again this weekend. Man, what a film.
",positive
10,"First off, since when did they start growing avatars with human imprints in case someone
dies? I thought avatars were piloted by humans and the only reason Jake was different
was because their god chose him to be in that body. That part felt completely hamfisted
into the film and seemed like an excuse to get some original cast members back.
",positive
11,"A lot of the reviews here argue ""Well, the story is boring but the visuals made up for it’.
To be honest, I wasn't blown away by the visuals either. Most of the movie looks
computer animated, like a video game. Nice yeah, but it really doesn't look like there's a
13 years difference to the first Avatar. It's not as stunning as back then
",positive
12,"Most filmgoers have spent the past decade in agreement that ‘Avatar’ was okay,
but rather clichéd and definitely not deserving of the biggest box office gross of all
time. At the time, the special effects were astonishing, zipwiring over the uncanny
valley in a way which had never been done before
",positive
13,"First off, I'm a HUGE fan of James Cameron, and not just his biggest hits, I also recognize
The Abyss as a brilliant film. So I was obviously waiting impatiently for over 10 years to
see this. The first Avatar was a visual feast with a story that served it well enough to
draw us in and make us care once the action (and deeply subversive message) of the
third act hit. Now that we're already familiar with Pandora and the characters, I was
hoping this one would build upon that story, while also introducing a new villain, raising
the stakes, and pushing the subversive message further, but no... that's not what
happens. (I won't spoil it, but if you've seen the film you know what I'm referring to
here.) This just felt like a lazy script that was thrown together quickly so they could
spend the majority of their time on the visual FX, which don't get me wrong, are
absolutely jaw-dropping. I gave the film 5/10 almost entirely for that reason
",positive
14,"Iam really not sure why Avatar and its sequel are a thing. The first one became the
highest-grossing movie of all time, and yet it made zero impact on culture what-so-ever.
Just think of the momentum and impact movies like Lord of the Rings, Toy Story or even
Twilight created. Regardless of whether you like them or not, one has to admit they made
it possible that new genres entered the big stage, they created fanbases that span the
whole globe and engage people up to today. But Avatar? At least here in Germany, the
movie disappeared from the public conscious after it left theaters. It was a simple story,
told in a new (at-that-time) interesting visual way. The story was also finished after the
first movie. The humans lost, they left. The End.
",positive
15,"It would be very easy to dismiss a film simple because it's popular and expensive,
but reviewing this film on its own merits I thought the opening was strong and had
the potential to be a very gripping film. It started to falter when the villain from the
first film was brought back to life in a new body and immediately started attacking
people in his confusion. He is then sat down and forced to watch a video of his
human self explaining (and barely understanding) that his memories have been
saved so that if anything happens they can be uploaded into a new avatar.

16,"The way of the water it's just a family adventures and sea creatures. The death
enemies are re-born out of imagination, the people are still hunting down and the
moon's resources. Just there Isn't the wow factor anymore. Even I found the CGI to
be not that realistic in the imagination part of the movie, the ""blue monkeys” were

not that vivid and I hoped for, maybe on IMAX there is better way to experience
the movie.
",negative
17,"What a ""none- movie""!! The story is so shallow as to be nonexistent. The characters and
the dialogue are weak. Everyone hypes about the ""visuals""? Really? A top tier director
with a budget of a billion dollars should be praised for producing good visuals? You can
get that on an Xbox game. It's like saying the toilet water was almost as blue as the sea,
it was so visually stunning. My teenage son was bored beyond belief and couldn't believe
I made him sit through over 3 hours of nothing!! Nothing intelligent. Nothing moving
Nothing memorable. Another over indulgent and over hyped Director serving up
meaningless video game content.

18,"Picture a scenario: you're the most evil man in the world and you're planning to
commit genocide, specifically hoping to cause suffering to one man. Then three of
his kids come to you, your henchmen take them hostage and you try to use them
to lead you to their dad. Instead, they resist you and repeatedly call you a

butthole.

19,"I watched the first Avatar out of curiosity and I must admit, I appreciated the
imagination put into the creation of the initial world. I hated the new age message
though and wasn't planning to see any more episodes but, you see, I'm married to
a boy who enjoys the visuals, so.

20,"Avatar: The Way of Water (2022) is a movie that we saw as a family last night in the
theatre. The storyline picks up after the previous film with Jake an Avatar, happily
married and with a family of his own. When the military returns and it is overheard their
mission is to kill Jake and his family, they move from the woods and go into hiding with
the people of the water. How long can they hide before the humans find them...and
finding Jake may not be their only motive...

or take this magical fish juice as to stay forever young? And why focus on one

22,"He's right. The motion capture, technology, cinematography, story, action sequences and
phasing all great. One of the movies you must watch in your lifetimel! It's beautiful,
touching and speak right into your heart...

23,"This is a really uneccessary sequel. It's the same old cheesy story of “Good nature people
living in paradise under attack from evil sadistic colonialists"". There's nothing new,
nothing surprising, the movie is predictable from beginning to end. If you know the first
one, you know this one too. The biggest problem is that the simple story is stretched to 3
hours! I felt bored a lot and was glad when the movie was finally over.

24,"More artificial worlds are waiting for the masses. I still can not understand the hype.
There is nothing special about both Avatar movies. They just look like a videogame or
PIXAR movie. They are so successful because they are so simpel, that really everyone
can follow the plot. Switch your brain off and forget everything else. It is just escapism
Some people would watch this 24/7, just to forget the world and themselves. James
Cameron is the master of distraction. This is entertainment for the brainwashed masses.
Their brains really need this silly movie. And of course it is also about the money, lots of

money.
