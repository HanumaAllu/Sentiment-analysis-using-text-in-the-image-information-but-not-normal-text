0,"1 loved the 1st film and I've just come out of the cinema watching the 2nd film. I am
heartbroken and sad because the story has so many plot conveniences and doesn't really

go anywhere. There isn't really anything at stake, the plot was written by a beginner and
has no depth.
",negative
1,"Compare this to, say, Harry Potter 2. The story was multilayered and compelling. The
characters were lovable and emotionally engaging. The visuals were artistically beautiful
and infused with meaning
",positive
2,"Given the success of the original Avatar, writing an excellent script (even if it meant
hiring others) should have been priority number 1. All this talk about pushing the limits of
CGI and camera technology, underwater filming etc... Totally worthless if the story and
characters are bland.
",positive
3,"Avatar 2 is so inferior to Avatar 1, I could not stress that enough. It is missing so many
elements that made the first movie, with an absolutely empty pointless story that seems
to be mish-mashed into the visuals. Avatar 2 has none of the mystic feeling energy that
the first one had. And after a 13 year wait, I just felt so disappointed with the movie, not
reaching any expectations whatsoever.
",negative
4,"This is not really a film. It has no shape, no thematic magic. There's no intellectual or
emotional structure to connect to. It's just a series of visually vibrant scenes.
",positive
5,"Avatar 2 is a big, meaningless, dumb, blue blur. I kept the faith for James Cameron for all
these years, but he didn't even bother to nail the most important aspect of a film: the
SCRIPT!
",positive
6,"There's barely a story. The characters are one dimensional and the dialogue is bland. The
main character is as interesting as a coat hanger. The visuals, while technically
impressive, are limited in their substance and highly repetitive.
",positive
7,"This sequel has a poor script, the main characters are not developed at all - single
dimensional, uninteresting. The special effects never improved. Nothing new was brought
to the table. This is purely a modern Hollywood cash grab with a story that doesn't even
meet the standard of 2023 Hollywood mediocrity.

Here is a perfect example why people are reluctant to invest $60 for a couple or $100+
to take the family to a movie, Imagine, dumping an afternoon and a bunch of money on
this and greasy popcorn
",negative
8,"At the very best I would rate this 5, just for the visuals, and even that includes some bad
CGI on a couple of occasions which I thought was really bad coming from James
Cameron. The boat crashing scene just looks like something from a 90s computer game.
",negative
9,"Surprisingly Bad - Even For A Sequel.

The first Avatar was groundbreaking and the script was well written. I, Avatar 1, time
was taken to develop the characters. They had depth and we invested ourselves in them.
",negative
10,"Absolutely awful film, soo boring. All 4 of us wanted to leave before end, it was basically
exactly the same story as first one only much much slower. Really awful sequel cant think
of a worse one. Why is it 192minutes? If they cut out half that it would still be boring,
like its unbelievably slow and tedious, the characters are all unlikeable, I can't get over
how bad much of the dialogue was in this movie, but especially the dialogue among the
teens. The overuse of the words ‘bro! and ‘cuz’ was awful and embarrassing, The Na'vi
bullies were also way too cliched. The villain is rehashed from first one, only you guessed

it worse. How it gets 7.7 is beyond me. Trust me if you enjoyed first one skip this its
garbage.
",negative
11,"Cameron's jumped the shark along with Lucas. This is Camerons Phantom Menace.

Please end the madness of worshipping these over rated story tellers. No one will pop the
inflated egos of these giant legendary directors so we keep getting this drivel. This movie
sucked Period. Slow and uninspiring on all levels. A 5 because i like the color blue and I
had a good nap. Probably should be a 3. One more to come too, OMG How much money
has to be wasted, Please for the luv of all things decent and good tell this man to move
on and tell a story we will remember. I don't care how revolutionary the movie technically
is if i fall asleep. Avoid it you won't regret it.
",negative
12,"It is literally the same story but in water... why bother? Visually, it looks like a very good
and a very very long computer game intro... Story-vise extremely dull, predictable and
sorry to say but boring... Cameron knows how to press the emotion buttons and that's
it... they should make a Disney+ series out of it and not a 3 hours long movie...
obviously people don't want complicated stories or good dialogue cause that movie
doesn't offer it and still made almost 2 billion... What a world we live in... I would say I
am disappointed but I didn't expect much to begin with... First movie was already very
dull and boring story-vise but at least it was visually first of its kind and it was worth
watching but the second one doesn't even have that pioneer effect it is just milking the
cash cow instead of telling a good story.
",positive
13,"On a more positive note, once this comes out on DVD, I'd definitely recommend playing it
in the background of a house party. Just drink every time one of the kids say ""bro"", and
you're gonna have a lot of fun (before passing out drunk by the time the movie is over !)

You're welcome <3
",positive
14,"T'll keep this short, don't go see this in the theaters. The plot is even worse than the first
one, and so much of this movie could have been cut out. Yeah the visuals were great as
the first but that's the only thing carrying this movie. Unbelievable for how long it took
for this movie to come out that the plot is this this thin and weak. It's totally predictable
the same as the first one. The dialogue is very cringy as well, using awful, trendy, buzz
phrases, and words. ""I got this!!"" ""Samel!"" Etc etc Cameron's talents could've been put
through so much better use. I'm amazed they are making several more of these...
",positive
15,"Unpopular opinion, but this was easily the worst James Cameron movie in recent memory
for me A pretty animation and a visual spectacle for sure, but unbelievably bloated and
littered with questionable choices... To enjoy this movie would require that one throws all
logic out the window, and despite such a long runtime, a coherent plot and character
development are still virtually nonexistent.
",positive
16,"As a huge fan of Avatar 1 which literally revolutionized 3D viewing I'm utterly
disappointed with the soulless, plotless visual sensation.. Hoped Cameron wouldn't mess
it up a sequel of a masterpiece. After all he is human.. Avatar 3 must be a kickass else
this franchise will be buried in time.. With the expectations and precedence set by 1st
and bottomless pit shown lack of imagination in 2nd part definitely you got your work cut
out..Come on James let your testosterone driven wild creativity do it's magic once again
like good old days when you had it in you.. Don't torture audience with this imbecile
graphical experiment!
",positive
17,"I thoroughly enjoyed the original Avatar and whilst the special effects and graphics of the
sequel were stunning that's the only reason I gave it 2 stars.

The storyline is weak with many unbelievable elements, the script is full of very strong
American family and military influences which are cringe making in the extreme and its
too long (3 hours too long in my opiniont!)

We would have left early if we hadn't been with friends but turned out they felt the same
and the general murmur of those round about us as we left was that it was rubbish
",positive
18,"The story really was all nonsense and a complete bore from the first one. They couldn't
come up with any original characters and the theme of the same group of humans
coming to steal their land and resources again magically inserted into avatar bodies.
Come on! But to make it worse let's just hunt 1 person/family to help accomplish this is
ridiculous. We couldn't get out of the theatre fast enough from the boredom of the lack of
story line. If I hear the word bro or brah one more time it will be to soon. The 3hrs felt

like 5. Please do not waist your money or time and I'm only typing now as it won't let me
leave a review without 800 characters.
",negative
19,"Jake sully integrated into whole Na'vi culture just to become classic patriarch military
American dad? Neytiri was not in the picture until the end of the movie she is just
agreeing with stuff. Also why all of a sudden everyone speaks English? All teenagers kept
saying bro all the time to an annoying level. Hated the plot. They should have looked
more into native cultures to make it less white culture, Visuals being good is not an
excuse for plot to be this sucky. They didn't even bother with creative villain position and
motivation. I also expected Kate Winslet's role to be bigger to train such extreme levels
to hold her breath underwater.
",negative
20,"But boring AF. It simply is a Mark 2 version if the first movie.

We watched with our kids (and just for the kids) Not even an hour into the movie, I
grabbed my mobile phone and was doing something else. It didn't feel like I was missing

something
",negative
21,"How terrible is your imagination to make such a boring action movie? :))))..... why over 2
hours? For what ? Dialogue, texts even a 12 years child could do it better... i saw
cartoons with better communication, this movie is for young 14 years old girls... who still
wants to believe in blue skin :))))... bed time stories... After 1 hour the movie it's still
boring... why ??? Most of the images are just copy paste from the first movie ... that's
the last avatar movie for me ... can't believe you are going to do 2 more ... same
bullsh..t like the family in fast and f..ed :)}) 0 imagination, 0 creativity, Overload boring...
be honest did you copied all texts from 10 movies and you made this movie on a toilet
break?

 
",positive
22,"Visually? Beautiful. But thirty minutes of that is enough. Watch 30 minutes, walk away,
you'll love it.

Honestly it is very easy to cut the runtime in half. The amount of loose ends, meaningless
arches and the absolutely unempathetic characters (new and old) turned a bad movie
into a torture for the last 60 minutes
",negative
23,"Iam 36 years old and for the first time in my whole life 1 was thinking of leaving the
theater after two hours of this completely empty visual spectacle...

My wife wanted to finish it, so we did. And we both regret it.
",negative
24,"Two stars only because producers spent a budget equivalent to GDP of a small country on
the visuals. Zero plot, no character development, no emotions, killer of a length, money
wasted. Also, it's so conventional and conservative aka no deviation from traditional
values, and even those and butchered by Jake and his partner. Thought that we were
done with white male saviour image but alas James Cameron definitely loves this one. Re
visuals - yes, quite impressive but hurts your eyes during fast action scenes. Do not
recommend, spend your time and money watching Moana and Titanic, much better value.
",positive
25,"After 10 mins of watching the special effects this movie is just boring - even then the
special effects are so over engined it feels fake and I wonder why they used actors at
all....it has barely a plot/ Storyline it was like a book for 2 year olds especially not one
that can sustain 3 hours of entertainment. What is there is hackneyed and repetitive.
",positive
26,"13 years and in the end all we got was a national geographic lesson?

Poorly told story. The writers seemed to have forgotten the plot behind the reincarnation
of the already vanquished general. The explanation of their existence to defeat Jake Sully

makes no sense
",negative
27,"Yes. The film overall sucked and is almost nothing like the first one and I mean the magic
and the soul, is just gone!

To keep things short, my overall Avatar rating as compared to what I look for in a good
film
",positive
28,"195 minutes of boredom. The animals carried this movie more than the characters. Why
did the generals son suddenly start showing the general the way of the avatar. Why
would they go through all that trouble to become avatars if you were not going to use it

to your advantage.
",negative
29,"The Blue conservatives fear any change. They don't have any sustainable economy, and
depend on parasitical cargo culture. When the different races of blue people fight against
each other, they switch to talking in English. All the races of blue people seem to share
the same strange embarrassment and shame about nipples. This installment introduces

implausibly miscegenetic half breeds. Presumably intended as an opportunity to lecture
on metis oppression.
",negative
30,"The art from the original Dances With Smurfs has been recycled successfully. No budget
was wasted on any pretense of plot. It's jam packed with maximum nonsense, just as set

ups for morality lessons. Lessons such as: ignore evidence based medicine, depend only
on prayer and acupuncture.
",negative
31,"Effects are well done. But it feels like a computer game. The effects did not blow me
away like when the first movie came out. Nothing really inventive has been done.

Boring as hell

Thin dialogues and characters. Predictable.
",negative
32,"I drove my 2004 Nissan Altima to this movie with the expectations that it would distract
me from my chronic mental deterioration. I however gained a few extra disorders. This
movie was so painful my open heart operation where I was given to little anaesthesia and
was accidentally stil conscious was a better experience. This movie is like going on a walk
with your weird uncle. You expect it to be fun and short. But it is long and traumatizing. 1
rather watch the top ten live leak decapitations than watch this horrendous pile of story
less death of a franchise dog doodoo. I watched a small child write a story about a dog. It
was written in crayon on a post it note but stil however had a better story line than this
movie, The last time I was this dissatisfied is when I went to a brothel in Vietnam and
found out there where to swords in this fight. This movie made me so mad I felt like
remaking a scene from the Jeffrey dahmer documentary. Long story short if you want to
flee the country without your kids leave them at this horrendously boring and stale movie
and drive to Mexico.
",negative
33,"If you like a movie in which a psychopath with an army chases down a defenceless family
of mostly kids then this is the film for you. There's nothing more to it than that, really, no
subtlety, no nuance, just a giant sledgehammer of a plot surrounded by pretty looking
scenery.
",negative
34,"Loved the visuals, especially the underwater scenes as these were awesome in 3D
(definitely see it in 3D for this alone) but hated the crappy ‘Family’ plot. I get that this is
supposed to be a family friendly movie but it was a Vomitfest throughout! Zero plot
unless you call repeatedly saving your brats plot. It was so bad I'm doubtful I'll even
bother with the remaining episodes of this ‘franchise’. I just can't face the nauseating
Brat Family again for another Vomitfest session... It really was dire! Cameron seems to
have thrown the plot to the wolves with this movie. Not recommended except to see the
CGI visuals! I expected so much more but this? Just sad! Disappointing and sad! Visually
stunning but the plot is SO Crap!
",negative
35,"While the level of animation and some of the creature desings are undoubtedly
spectacular, this film lacks any sort of story arch or character development to let the
viewer become invested. Being inundated non-stop by a bewildering amount of
exaggerated action sequences for more than three extremely long hours only leaves the
audience emotionally detached, if not feeling empty, It is nothing but a sensory overload.
I might as well have watched a Marvel franchise backwards... or Titanic for the millionth
time! Perhaps it could make for a lovely screensaver. Otherwise it is an utter waste of
time

36,"It has been a really long time that I have considered walking out of a movie. There are
stunning scenes and it is well acted, but... - where is the story? And what story there Is:
what is different to Avatar, part 177? Great creatures and scenery, but do we really need
2 hours of fighting and conflict...and pretty much more of the same? I don't think I will
be back for parts 3, 4 and so on!

actual target group (mid. 20s, that watched Part 1 - 13 years ago).

I didn't like the movie at all and I am very disappointed by what modern movies seem to
become... cashcows with 1h showdowns, that are so boring and repetitive, you start
falling asleep.
",negative
39,"Storytelling is very poor and almost the same, as in the first movie. The movie seems like
written by an AI. More fighting scenes than lore.

Also translations are very bad because ""bro"", ""dad"" and ""buddy"" are no authentic words,
for a spiritual species living on an other planet

41,"Technically the film was well made and especially underwater the 3D effects were very
nice, but that was it for me.

For me the glorification of the military/marine and weapons were particularly annoying,
with the lesson for the audience that you can only win with violence.
",negative
42,"The plot from Avatar 1 is repeated with a few Titanic scenes. Furthermore, the children
had to be saved nearly four times...

It was not worth the money, it was restless in the cinema because many people were

watching the clock, there was no suspense and there were also illogical elements in the
film.

call him sir and the wife is sometimes forbidden to speak, she is more like a practical

45,"Animated kids cartoon movie, no strong story, old and weak script serve with hight ticket
rate to make public fool, seems we are watching NGC channal in animated form,
extended long movies without any sense.if the film will earn money no suprise due to
advertising and false scripted promotion. I wasted my INR1000 IN IMAX 3D, but you
guys can be lucky to save your time and money. No much 3D effects, nothing is reality,
all are graphics and computer work, nothing suprise in this movies, director tried incash
the popularity of the 1st part. Not upto expectations. Feels like cheap quality Chinese
movie watching in high rate.
",positive
46,"As others have wrote, I am not sure anyone cares about Jake Sully and his family as
much as James Cameron thinks they do. I have never really understood the fascination
with Avatar, so I had no expectations going in to seeing this. The visuals many people are
impressed by felt like watching 3 hour intro to a computer game, while the story and
dialogue makes for a paper-thin and painfully boring story that is predictable, shallow
and clearly lacks character development
",negative
47,"Colossal disappointment here. I can't believe a 3.2 hour movie had such dull and puerile
dialogue. The middle hour of whales and teenage dullards had me wanting to open a
book till it was over. He still does the action stuff brilliantly but the finale was strangely
lacklustre. The music was cliched and the noble savage sentimentality was grating
Overall worst was the teenagers ""bro"". The convoluted heavy lifting of the exposition to
get the returning characters back was weird and clumsy.
",negative
48,"They clearly decided that it was a good idea to hire a bunch of national geographic nature
documentary makers and spend the rest of the money in special effects, instead of

investing even a little bit into a well thought script, or even a good music to accompany
the movie.

this one is so bad that I will never look at the first one the same way.

50,"It's just sad that we had to wait 10 years for a movie that was clearly written by a gang
of Disney Channel writers. There is the argument that the special effects are awesome,
which they are but it doesn't justify the awfulness of this storyline
",positive
51,"This is the first film after which I felt I had to write a review to confirm how bad it is.
Visually stunning of course, but it's like watching a nature film, which I'm not that
interested in, given that it's about a fictional world. The story was dumb, predictable and
full of plot holes. Jake Sully and his family reminded me of the ""7th Heaven"" TV series (I
wanted to write ""This is Us"", but I don't want to mislead anyone that Avatar 2 would be
on the same level): portrayal of a strong family with minor and major dramas, filled with
moral lessons, but for some reason the protagonist of Avatar makes irrational decisions. I
didn't care about the fate of the characters, I wasn't moved at all and if they had 2 hours
more screen time, it wouldn't change. Beautiful film, but most boring film of my life.
",negative
52,"Felt like a copy paste of the first movie which is 13 years old now. They did not learn
anything in those 13 years except that if they call a movie Avatar it will make them way
too much money. I'm actually upset I watched this movie. They got me. There is not
much more to say. This review has a minimum length? Super odd. All I can say is itis a
waste of time. The only reason to put this on is for background noise and even then
probably not a good idea because of loud sequences. I need 100 more characters. I did
not enjoy this movie. It put me to sleep. It was the same as the first movie, seriously.
",negative
53,"Visually, CGI stunning; plot wise, wakey-wokey. Overly long by a full hour; pretentious in
setting. As with most if not all sequels, the original was better, but that isn't saying much
as the first version was just like this; ""second verse, same as the first"". If you saw the
first version, then you've already seen everything you need to know about this one. Yes,
I'm repeating myself as there isn't any reason to go see this one, much less for it to even
exist. If you want to sleep for three hours in a comfy chair, stay home where you can get
your own snacks without having to pay an arm and a leg. Have I made my self clear;
AVOID LIKE THE COVID PLAGUE.

54,"Were excited initially but after watching it, to come out of boredom , Had to watch Avatar
Lagain !!

Way of water Looks pretty but captivating it is not.
1. Script was missing. Story was a drag.

2. Fascination of the commander with Jack Sully. This was the most awful though te bring
down the whole movie from 10 stars to less than three stars. If there had a slightly less
predictable story line or any attempt at making the characters have depth and charisma
this movie could of been something for me. But it didn't and therefore makes the 3 hours
drag on and on

3. Over hyped 13 years waiting and a story that could of been covered in an hour. Good
that I didn't watch in premier Theaters (Saved some money) 4. There will be another
Avatar next, again with the same lame story of fascination of commander with Jack and
both their kids would join their fathers as well . It is easily predictable how movie ended

56,"Unpopular opinion: Without even talking about the problems surrounding a rich old white
guy trying to tell a story about colonialism and the attempted genocide of Indigenous

that even the visual effects didn't really impress me. Sure, they were objectively
stunning, but there was very little in the story or the characters to engage or connect me
with the setting. As other commenters have said, I was shocked that this was over a
decade in the making

57,"The plot was very predictable. The action was cheesy at best. I'm very surprised this is
even a James Cameron flick, Just a total let down from beginning to end. Has CGI run its

of cartoon! Is this the new CGI or something? Either way its ugly! Same like that new
GoT series, most expensive serie but it looks so much worse than the old GoT. Avatar is
the same! At one point they even cartoonized humans in some scenes, a green screen
was too much work or so?

had a pretty decent subplot and was one of the only characters I liked.

In essence I've watched the whole movie mostly at 1.5 speed, and during the annoyingly

nightmarishly stupid, the story lacks any kind of subtlety and is as foreseeable as it gets
The brutally one-dimensional characters are forced into unnecessary conflicts based on
the flimsiest of reasons. Sure, it is sometimes nice to look at but not worth spending
three hours of absolute boredom. I was really hoping for James Cameron to land another
hit but this was as bad a movie as it gets and he should be ashamed of himself. The one
actress who carried large parts of the first movie was sidelined, the pacing is terrible and
I can see barely anything redeemable about this trash film. Let me know when James
Cameron has an original idea again, until then, I won't watch.

changed drastically since the last Avatar film. Avatar 2 is visually ok, nothing spectacular.

recycle and remake, such a shame for this film and that Cameron had to go down this
path.

71,"This was a long and boring film that relied too heavily on looking good without any depth
to the story. Frankly the main plot felt more suited to a side story which focused on
humans ‘calming the natives’ to exploit resources, but it actually was more about
revenge between the old general from this first Avatar and Jake Sully the rogue soldier.
During the film I did start to wonder whether the sky people's (aka humans) military
would be happy with pouring this amount of funding inte killing one rogue soldier.
Honestly I don't think they would, when they can just nuke everyone.

75,"So, the dumbest thing they could have possibly have dones...they did within the
first few minutes of the movie. Not 1, not 2, but 3 completely unbelievable events.
They clone the Colonel in a avatar form...and he has a human son also on planet,
and Sigomey Weaver has a daughter, even though she is dead...Did i miss
anything. Is there anyone out there that actually liked this beginning?

I think the Colonel should have been the main character. He could have fallen in
love with Pandora just as Jake did and we could have seen that hey, everyone who
goes to this planet gets changed. But no, they just wanted a generic bad guy and
nething more. An old rival. But the problem with this is there are already plenty of
people that think like this, we even saw them on screen, but they are only shown
once and never again. The movie actually started off following the Colonel after
being resurrected, and we think thats where the movie is heading but it was just
for one shot then it moves on.

So they don't have a very good reason for leaving the forest. The forest has been
under attack for years but now lets leave because im sure they will stop if we
leave.. More like an ostrich with its head in the sand. If we dont see it its not
happening.

You know what one line kinda ruined the movie for me. When they killed the whale
and said this stops human aging and is the only reason why we are on this
planet...What?!! WHat about unobtanium. Or did you really forget that is the only
reason why you are on the planet..or to terraform and kill all the natives was
another reason thrown out there. But its like Cameron completely forgot about
unobtanium, and so did all the humans.

And by the end of the movie we are exactly where we started, Humans are still on
pandora, nothing was solved, nothing was resolved. Why make a movie that has no
point?

76,"Honestly, I really don't believe the great reviews here. They must be PR people writing
them or people who have never seen good cinema before. I found it disrespectful to have
a repeat of the first film's plot, albeit in a different setting. Not only that, but considering
it was so BORING, and had cringeworthy dialogue, and the effects were overrated, I find
it hard to believe that anyone would bother giving more than 5 stars, let alone seeing the
3rd instalment when it comes out. I certainly won't. I'm giving it 3 stars because I
expected much more from the sequel. It's certainly no Aliens (now there's a great sequel
folks).

77,"Of course, I struggle with the fact that the film starts when it should end, with an hour-
long battle taken out of a Marvel film, with equally tiresome music.

It doesn't make up for the fact that it's beautiful, and although the CGI is great, I'm
surprised that it's just as bad at explosions. They look cheap. If there was something I
thought Cameron would fix, or at least pay for, it sows believable explosions.

78,"The strong suit of the first Avatar movie was for sure not the story (the retelling of
Pocahontas in a sci-fi context etc. - my rate for that one is a straight 8), so I did
not expect a sophisticated plot or something substantial, and like expected, the
story is nothing worth to mention or remarkable. Fore sure, The Way of Water is no
bad experience, the effects are fine, the production superb, so I dare to say, if you
liked the first one you will like this one most likely too. All in all I was entertained,
but the trip had some lengthy parts too, some cutting (like in many productions
these days) would have done some magick to the experience of The Way of Water.
Also the sensation of the new style like movies like the first Matrix, Sin City and
Avatar provided is gone - you know what you get. So I gotta confess, here and
there I was slightly bored, and sometimes it was like watching the cinematic to a
(well made) computer game. In my humble opinion, the media mostly does
overpraise this work by James Cameron like they did with the Dune remake by
Denis Villeneuve. Eye-candy? Yes. Cinematic masterpieces? No.

ratings but took a risk, The cinema room had about 5% of seats occupied for the film.
One couple left part way though

It became clearer during the film based on the characters and dialogue that the target
audience is young teens and parents.

Something that can be applauded is the creativity of the wildlife animations.

Fight scenes created some excitement but didn't lift the film out of the muddy waters.
The really dull plot spoilt the film and made it very tiresome to watch.

world-building, and action were all off the charts. But Avatar: The Way of Water
struggles like its predecessor in the story and character development departments.
In fact, the story of The Way of Water is almost identical to the first Avatar. Instead
of humans learning to be Na'vi and then fighting Stephen slang, a family of forest
Na'vi learns to be ocean Na'vi and then fight Stephen Lang. All the strengths and
weaknesses of the first movie are back in this one, with the bonus of being
compared to the original. It really is a visual feast and special effects masterpiece,
but just like the first Avatar, that's all it is.

are with absolutely zero story pushed and leaving audiences in limbo. Could have just
watched Nat Geo if i wanted to watch bright lights under water. Complete waste of time.

When the story did start it was a complete duplicate of the first. With the same hardships
and battles. How this movie took 10 years to make is beyond me.

Ive always defended Camerons films but this one is just a let down. With so much money
invested i just cant wrap my head around this.

Some people would watch this 24/7, just to forget the world and themselves. James

Their brains really need this silly movie. And of course it is also about the money, lots of

83,"James Cameron brings the biggest disappointment of the year. Avatar 2 is nothing
but empty beauty.

We start with a hurried introduction to the plot through some narration. Jake is a
happy dude and he's made some kids somehow. None of this is explained well
because apparently it doesn't matter. People are here again and they're evil again,
for reasons. Jake flees to a beautiful water world and we never hear of the forest
world after that. It's probably being destroyed, but who cares about the genocide
of their former tribe? Jake doesn't. His son is touching a whale he shouldn't touch
so that's way more interesting. For some reason humanity sends Miles’ clone after
Jake, spending massive amounts of money to hunt him down even though the
objective was only to stop Jake from creating an uprising, which has already
succeeded. Jake was laying low in hiding but for some reason they hunt him down
still.

For a three hour movie, Avatar 2 feels rushed quite often. Subplots are introduced
or hinted at and then get thrown away without resolve and big plot points feel
rushed, but we do get to spend half an hour watching a completely unnecessary
whalehunt. We're supposed to get attached to Jake's new kids but the only one
that shows some depth of character is the one that gets bullied and punished for it
over and over, even by his own father. It's very hard to feel attached to any of the
characters because they're all shallow husks. Dialogue is absolutely horrendous and
rarely gets any deeper than ""Come on bro, we gotta do this bro, it’s for family bro”.
The overuse of ""bro"" is maddening and brings the already terrible dialogue down to
sub-zero levels. None of the interactions feel natural. Spider as a character is the
epitome of this. He is not only horribly cast but added absolutely nothing to the
plot. All he did was politely ask Miles to stop killing a few times. The character in
this movie that shows the most depth and development is a whale. I'm not kidding.

The ending is extremely lackluster. The new water tribe is just discarded entirely.
There's no big fight where the water tribe helps out their new friends in their cool
watery ways. They join Jake on the ride there and then they just disappear and we
get a rehash of the beginning fight with the same five people we've been watching
for the past two hours doing the same things they've always done. Once again, the
only character saving this fight is that same whale. In the end the new waterworld
setting and all the people in it are nothing but a beautiful background instead of
something that actually plays into the plot and characters.

Is it all bad? No. Avatar 2 looks amazing. The action scenes are stunning and the
water world with all it's majestic creatures is beautiful. But that’s all there is. It's
empty beauty with no substance at all. And to me, that might just be the biggest
disappointment of the year, movie-wise.

84,"There is a reason Aristotle placed ""spectacle"" last behind plot, character, etc., in the
elements of drama. This movie is nothing but empty spectacle and cliched thought. A
literal trope fest. BUT THE DIALOG! Jeez? A few humans stay on the planet after the
previous incursion, and a few years later, the entire native culture speaks, thinks, and
behaves like US high-schoolers. Isn't part of settler colonism inflicting foreign culture on
the natives? Who would have thought that foreign culture would be American high-school

attitudes. It was a struggle to make it to the end. I had to keep fast forwarding through
painful dialog scenes.

it.. Just because it's a visual masterpiece, I cannot spend continuous 12-15 minutes just
watching the underwater animals.. It felt like watching some episode from National
Geographic or Animal planet...

Overall, if you cut 30-40 mins of such parts, you will still not miss anything in the story
line.. First half was mostly to setup the environment and was very lagging .. I was like
/""Okay.. I get it.. it's a great place with different creatures. Now, please move on to the
storyline.."".. Climax fight portion was good but not as great as the Avatar 2009 climax
fight.. After the fight we still get some 5-10 mins of lagging scenes.. ""Come on ... Finish
it already""

A major plot hole that I would think of is the reason for the presence of humans on
Pandora.. What happened to the reason from part 1?! And why all these unnecessary
hunting of someone who already fled the fight?!

Something that is even more unimaginable and incredible than Way of Waters visuals is
the writing negligence. It is so obvious what did and didn't work in the film, It also feels
like these issues should have been hilariously obvious when boarding the screen play or
script reading. There are a lot of these issues too. This feels so much like the disaster of
Lucas's full creative control of the prequels. James does have a reputation for being

haven't looked at the film in detail because so much happened and it was so visually

of the characters and give the story depth and weight that you only really get with TV

really thinking through the colonial themes, making it recursive of the first - even
with the exact same antagonists, which get more screen time despite that being
used little to no effect, except to perpetuate similar circumstances for the next
movie. How exasperating. LET THE BAD GUY GO FFS. The kid saying bro every five
seconds was excruciating. Why would they have the same vernacular as 20th
century people? Why would the kid have that affectation when no one else uses it?
It's so stupid.

It is bloated, indulgent, and repeats the same criticisms with a bullheaded script
that feels like it knows that and spits in the face of it. The only reason to see the
movie, as with the first, is the CGI. If you've seen any movie about outsiders living
with indigenous people threatened by the same culture, you've seen this movie.

91,"Avatar 2 is the long-awaited sequel to the 2009 blockbuster Avatar, directed by James
Cameron and starting Sam Worthington as Jake Sully, a former marine who becomes one
of the Na'vi, an alien race living on the planet Pandora.

The first one was like an even more romanticized version of Pocahontas. But did it really
need a sequel? I don't get the box office numbers. Just like almost any movie that makes
over 1 billion dollar. Is it Star Wars, Avengers, Jurassic, Animation flicks and so on. They
all feel the same and all rely on the power of a computer. Just like this one.

The film is a huge disappointment that fails to live up to the hype. Even though I had no
expectations. The story is dull and predictable, the characters are flat and uninteresting,
and the themes are clichéd and preachy. The film relies too much on CGI and spectacle,
but lacks any substance or emotion. The visuals are impressive at times, but also
artificial and repetitive. The film feels like a rehash of the first one, but with less

inality and creativity. Avatar 2 is an overrated and boring film that does not justify its
existence or its budget ($300 million) or only for the producers who get a 2 billion dollar
on so on outcome at the BO. It is still a waste of time and money for anyone who values
good storytelling or meaningful cinema. It is a film that only appeals to fans of blue
people and a fake worlds of CGI. I am so done with these kind of blockbusters. I would
give it 3/10 stars.

was how they returned some of the characters from the 1st movie which just fit right in.

The world he and his visual design team have created is truly a work of art... It's

heartfelt emotional passages. In all honesty, the story is awfully predictable, and an
almost step-by-step rehash of the first movie. But it's damn near impossible to be
bothered by this, because the magic is there, and it's real. And the whales... Oh my god,
the whales. Or whale-like creatures, anyway. Absolutely spellbinding, The familiar
characters are precisely the same as they were before, and it makes the past 13-year
wait seem like nothing at all. It's like meeting with friends you haven't seen for a while. I
especially love Zoe Saldafia, she was always the shining star of Avatar, and she's just as
mesmerising here, even if her screentime is a bit shorter. The new characters are all
good, strong additions to the whole. Cliff Curtis is very powerful as the Sea People's chief,

Maybe it's a little less great, but I'd have to sit with ita little while longer before I could
be sure.

First of all, this movie is long. 192 minutes long. I didn't feel the length, in all honesty. I
got wrapped up in the movie and how it looked and sounded so much that it probably
could have gone on another hour and I still wouldn't have felt restless. It's one of the
best-paced 3+ hour movies I've ever seen... and you could argue it's even paced a little

the same impact. While the ocean setting brings new creatures for us to marvel at
- it isn't as breathtakingly new as it was 13 years ago.

There are a lot of action set pieces and all of them are great to watch, although
they feel either repetitive or borrowed from previous Cameron films like Titanic.

For me, bringing back both the Grace character and the evil colonel felt too much.
One of them, Grace (Sigorney Weaver), would have been sufficient, the Colonel
could easily have been a brother like in Die Hard 3, although this would require
additional story changes regarding the adolescent « Spider » character. But that
would have been better than the whole « importance of Family » theme running
through everything. Just too much of that for me, as well as let's make sure only
incidental characters die.

The 3D and higher frame rate aspects added nothing extra for me, and at times
made it feel like video and not like a real film - although interestingly this video feel
was not always there like in the Hobbit films, but would come and go.

The story of this film becomes a battle between Jake and the cloned Colonel, with
the rest of the global aspect of Pandora verses Humans dropping by the wayside. It
would have been more interesting if the new antagonist, not a clone of the Colonel,
disobeys his orders from the General and goes AWOL to hunt down Jake - like
Captain Ahab and the white whale.

protecting your loved ones is not new to us, but it was ingenious. James Cameron's level
of perfectionism translates to the audience; the details of every frame are precise and I

memories into an avatar to keep him alive. Humans returned to Pandora to kill Jake
and extract goo from whales. I'm sure the goo had a name but I don't recall what it
was, hopefully it was more thought inducing than..... Unobtainium. Sigh.

124,"We went to see Avatar 2 in a beautiful movie theater and looked forward to it.
Never watched the trailer to be honest. And we couldn't make it through the whole
thing. Us and several other people left after 1,5 hours.
",positive
125,"Not to say I did not like the first one cause I did, but It was not the best movie I ever
scene, and this sequel is better than that.
",negative
126,"Some films are just pure escapism and sometimes that's what audiences need, and this
is what Avatar 2 delivered, Avatar 2 doesn't necessarily check all those boxes to become
a great film, but what it does right will offer viewers moments of astonishment, full-body
immersion, and beauty. You can easily watch the movie and points out its mistakes and
flaws, but it is hard to resist the fun and adventure the film delivers throughout its 192
minutes runtime. It is clear that James Cameron is making this movie for a general
audience, and while imperfect, it certainly seems to serve its purpose.
",positive
127,"I'm sorry, but wow. I went into this expecting very little and still walked away
feeling underwhelmed. This movie is beyond tedious and the pretty visuals only
distract you for so long.
",positive
128,"Seriously 8+ ratings??! Have we watched the same movie with the blue and green
monkeys?
",negative
129,"The story is actually not as tight as the original tale, but it's a better story. It just flows
slower than the original. There will be a point for all of us where the story slows down
enough to make you realize you have to go to the bathroom and that's how much you

actually love the film. For me I think that was 12 or 15 minutes before the end credits
rolled. That's pretty good.
",positive
130,"Jake and Neytiri are more or less supporting characters, the focus is on their
children. The movie really shoves the nuclear family agenda down your throat. One
wonders if James Cameron has spent too much time in Pandora to realize that the
world has changed, and a family doesn’t have to be a nuclear family, if one even
decides to start a family in the first place.
",positive
131,"Avatar 2 is a huge disappointment. It is a poor rehashing of the original film with nothing
new to say. The movie is far too long, clocking in at a staggering 3 hours. I found myself
constantly checking my watch, waiting for it to end. The pacing of the film is slow and the
story feels dragged out. The special effects were impressive, but they couldn't save the
film from its lack of substance.
",negative
132,"See it on the biggest screen you can, in 3D, and savour every moment of it.
",negative
133,"First, let's get it out of the way. This movie looks very pretty. The CGI work to make not
only the Navi, but the entire world look realistic is incredibly impressive. Unfortunately,
these fantastic visuals are not presented in any interesting way. The cinematography
leaves much to be desired. It is not bad per se, but nothing is done to uplift the
incredible CGI work. Once the luster of the visuals fade, there is not much to hold the
viewers eye for the rest of the movie. This is also overlooking the strange framerate
issues that pop-up throughout the film. These inconsitencies immediately pull you out of
the experience.
",positive
134,"I liked it, but it wasnt worth waiting 13 years to see. I dont get how it took 13 years for
this to be made. I felt like I was watching Titanic again near the end. It was beautiful, but
lacked any real story or anything new. I guess I was expecting so much more waiting so
long and having to sit in the theater for so long too. I did cry a little, so I gave it 6 stars,
but Finding Nemo was more interesting. The story was weak and cookie cutter I've seen
that before kinda thing. Why couldnt we have more animal fighting? I loved that in the
first one. I just feel so empty and wish I could have some kind of warm fuzzy feeling and
glad I watched it, but I dont think it was worth the wait. I guess I'll be dead before the
3rd Avatar comes out at this rate.
",positive
135,"Utterly boring pathetic attempt to cash In on the original which was far superior in every
way.

Utterly stupid to put Quadritch in an avatar body when he failed and died in the first one.
",negative
136,"The movie tries to replicate the success of the first one but fails in adding anything new
to the story. It is a rehash of the first movie with the same characters and themes. There

are no new ideas. The only thing that changes is the location, but it doesn't add much to
the story.
",negative
137,"The characters have no depth, a big problem when it comes to Jake's identical two
sons. They are impossible to tell apart. 14-year old Sigourney Weaver has almost
no purpose except the ending, same with Spider.
",negative
138,"Its a little disappointing if I'm honest. Even the much touted special effects didn't deliver
the wow of the first film.
",negative
139,"There's a moon that's called Pandora far away, its unique flora and its fauna hold the
sway, keeping everything aligned, a rooted network gives a spine, but vengeful enemies
return, to have their day. The indigenous in this place are called Na'vi, harmonious and
peaceful and they're free, with Jake Sully as their chief, they have the power and belief,
to force adversaries away and make them flee. But these invaders play their cards as.
Avatars, it gives them strength to match the locals and it jars, so Jake moves his family,
away to islands out at sea, taking to the air, while traveling afar.
",positive
140,"What I found interesting is that the hole hoopla of the film is that its filmmaker James
Cameron had to wait the 12 to 13 years for the technology capable to make this film. You
could say the sign of a good director was that I could not tell what that technology was
capable of, but I have to say, visually, that first film was far more outstanding than what I
saw here.
",positive
141,"The main ""stars"" said in a video/trailer that this movie is like the first but on steroids, or
100x more intense than the first one... but hey, what else should they say? They gotta
promote it, right?
",positive
142,"The story is very very basic which leaves plenty of time to get fully emersed into the
world of Pandora. Except after a time that world fails to deliver any great discoveries
compared to the first film. It feels very much a repeat.
",positive
143,"Its entertaining enough to not be a waste of time and the big screen in 3d will be the
best way to see it, as once the effects are diminished in the lounge room the story, or
lack of it, will come to the fore :)
",positive
144,"The music is forgettable and there is no signature or motif that one remembers,
the ending is underwhelming and unresolved , it implies more of the same in
avatar 3, Sam worthington's acting is stilted, the screenplay is not well written or
exciting, there are no big surprises or twists and there is no humour or relief . My
12 yr old daughter thought it was forgettable and too long. But, it looks amazing;
shame someone can't do something original with this technology.
",positive
145,"Cameron minions will act as if they just watched the second coming of Jesus but this
movie, just like its predecessor, is nothing more than smoke. If filmmaking is all about
wide shots and technological achievement then yes it is the greatest movie of all time.
Unfortunately, some people enjoy deeper movies, with strong narratives, great
performances, deep themes. Avatar 2 offers none of that. James Cameron has once again
achieved something unparalleled: another 3h+ movie with absolutely nothing of
substance. Nothing. It's the same terrible outcome the first one offered wrapped in the
most beautiful package. It's enough for some but I'd like to think those with a little more
intellectual curiosity will see right through the joke this movie is: Dances with Wolves in
Outer Space Part II, Dumber Edition.
",positive
146,"Well, that was.. something. Yes, like everybody else I agree: the visuals were
stunning. That's why it's getting 1 star.
",positive
147,"I'm over 50 and have been a cinephile all my life and frankly the general trend in
sci Fi since Star Wars has been to go big on effects and less devoted to the story
line which all are very similar . Greed , revenge, and a fight sequence at the end
that goes on for ever.
",negative
148,"I wasn't expecting anything from the story seeing as the story in the first movie
was average but fun to watch. So I went in blind. It really felt like a next-gen video
game and if it were a game I would've liked it more - I think. But for me it was just
awful.
",positive
149,"Avatar 2 is no exception. It looks gorgeous , and one has to admire the technology
in rendering such lifelike animation using modern motion capture. This is the part
which I don't mind. The story however is more of the same , the film is too self
indulgent at times and drags on too long . Just because a sequence locks gorgeous
or lots of money has been spent on it, doesn't mean it has to be included.
