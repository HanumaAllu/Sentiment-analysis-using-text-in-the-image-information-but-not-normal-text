0,"1am 24 years old and | have just recently discovered the Harry Potter series. | grew up in a conservative household and Harry Potter was banned when | was a child. Now that |
am an adult my beliefs are much more liberal than that of my family. | heard one of my friends (who is almost 20 years my senior) talking about how much she likes the Harry
Potter series, so | decided to rent the Sorcerer's Stone movie. | liked it so much that | immediately ordered the book. | started reading it and found that it was really hard to put it
down. | finished it this morning and I love the book. The story really draws you in. | found myself really empathizing with Harry and always wanting to find out what would
happen next. I liked it so much that I ordered the second book. Thankfully it should be here tomorrow, because | cannot wait to ""visit"" Hogwarts again!

1,"What other rating can you give Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone?? It’s the book that launched hope in every child's life. It launched an empire. If you were ever made fun of
or treated unfairly- this got you through it all. It’s a 1000% 5-star rating.

2,"This was actually the second time I'd read Book One. | read it when it first came out. It was still very entertaining, even years later. | was never bored, not once, and even though |
knew what was going to happen, it was so much like visiting with old friends, that didn’t bother me.

My only complaint, and it is minor, is that some of the writing is a bit awkward, Ms. Rowling got much better as the series ran on, but her early efforts were a tad amateurish.

All that aside, Ms. Rowling deserves the accolades she’s received. The POTTER series is a massive accomplishment, highly entertaining, incredibly creative, and a whole lot of fun!

3,"It took me over a month to read this book. | have watched all the movies in this series before finally deciding to read the books. But that was not an easy thing to do. The cover
threw me off completely. | don't regret watching the movies before reading the books because if I did it that way, the Harry Potter series would be another series I passed by
solely because of these childish, kiddie covers. But then yet, it is a children's series. | wish the kindle covers were the paperback covers.

Well, | didn't really care for the first movie so maybe that’s why my opinion on the book is the same. | was curious to read it and find out all the things people say the movie
directors and producers left out, But | mostly wanted to read the books to get more Weasley twin scenes. Turns out nothing important was left out and the twins were just

mentioned in passing if they were not seen.

4,"When | first read this book 12 years ago, | was all of 12 years old. I'd never really been into books at that point in my life, but apparently my mom thought that that ought to
change. One night, a copy of this book showed up on my nightstand, with a note saying that this book was apparently quite popular with boys my age. Reluctantly, | began to
read it, and was unexpectedly sucked in to a world of magic the likes of which I'd never quite imagined. I churned through it quickly, and read it several times over, eagerly
anticipating the release of the next book.

As much as | enjoyed it, when I learned that my girlfriend hadn't yet shared the experience, | decided to buy her a copy for Christmas. She recently finished it, and now I'm
rereading it. Gotta say, the book's just as good as | remember it being all those years ago... | would recommend it to anybody.

5,"I loved this book, but when | read of the Sorcerer's Stone I had a nagging feeling about it at the back of my mind, until it struck me that all the descriptions of it matched what |
had always known as a Philosopher's Stone. | first learned of the Philosopher's Stone when | was 10 years old and read a book called ""Gone-Away Lake"" by Elizabeth Enright, and
then of course read more of it when studying European history.

As the Encyclopedia Brittanica puts it: ""in alchemy, substance thought to be capable of changing base metals into gold. The same term, more fully elixir vitae, “elixir of life,"" was
given to the substance that would indefinitely prolong life-a liquid that was believed to be allied with the philosopher's stone.”

Iwas quite confused, but then | discovered that it England the book *was"" originally called ""Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone"". This title makes so much more sense.
What the heck is a sorcerer’s stone? Nothing. Why the change? Does Scholastic Books just think American's are dumb, ignorant fools? | can't think of any other reason for the

change.

6,"I was a little late to the Harry Potter craze, having been raised to believe that this book was the work of the Devil and never having the time to read seven extra books during
college. However, after being assigned to read this book in a young adult literature class at the age of twenty-five, | was hooked. The plot is imaginative, the characters are
interesting and fully developed, and the book is well written yet simple enough for children to enjoy. After finishing the class, | continued to read the other six books, which are

equally amazing.
",positive
7,"That | arn just now reading the Harry Potter series would surprise no one who knows me. I'm usually a good 3-5 years behind trend. Harry Potter has legions of adoring fans and
noted detractors, who are in turn drowned out by the passion of Harry Potter fans. | understood nothing of HP before | read my first book, which was ironically book three:
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban. After reading the first book I'm now proud to say that | am a fan, maybe not to the extent that some people are, since I've largely
missed being on the ten year journey of most Potter fans. I'm also living proof that you can still get something out of the books, even if the wave has driven past you.

What impressed me is that J.K. Rowling didn't fall into the trap of many authors of young adult literature by creating these cliché stock characters that appear built out of
cardboard. Furthermore, every detail of the world of Harry Potter feels as though it was meticulously crafted by a painter or a sculptor rather than an author—true talent
indeed. Even seemingly minor characters are intimately fleshed out. I think its’ these two factors that give Harry Potter its’ unique place in contemporary literature. | decline to.
provide a plot summary, because so many reviewers have done those already, and plus Harry Potter is really about an experience that goes deeper than a book.

8,"There has been a lot of fuss about “satanic” elements in the Harry Potter novels, so | was careful to read this book before passing it along to my nephew as a Christmas gift.
Frankly, | didn't find any reason for concern: the book is very much in the tradition of such children's classics as Baum's Oz novels, which have featured witches, sorcerers, goblins
and the like without ever once being accused of satanic overtones.

The major difference between such as the Oz books and Harry Potter is that Ozand others like it--are set in a completely imaginary world, while Harry Potter is not. While this
is probably the very thing that its detractors find most upsetting, it is actually the very thing that makes the book so much fun to read, for its fantasy elements take ona literal
quality that allow for the willing suspension of disbelief in a way not previously seen in books written for children. It is a very sophisticated bit of writing, and I look forward to
reading the other books in the series myself.

These are not, by the way, books written for young children. Most six and seven year olds will be completely out of their depth. They are more appropriate to the ten-year-old

and over crowd, who will have less difficulty reading them on their own.

9,"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is the first book in a series of seven that tells the story of a young boy who is orphaned as a baby when his parents are killed by a dark
wizard who tries to kill Harry too, but Harry survives the attack and all he is left with is a scar on his forehead that identifies him as the only living wizard known to be able to
survive Voldemort. After the attack as a baby is sent to live with his human or ""muggle"" relatives where for ten years, he is never told he is a wizard; and he receives harsh and
cold treatment from them because they desperately want to fit into the ""normal"" world and Harry is anything but ordinary.

Harry only finds out about his past ,his wizard lineage, and how his parents died, when he gets his letter from Hogwarts; an academy for young wizards and witches. Then the
real adventure begins, as Harry discovers a world of magic, makes friends, and enters a world where instead of being invisible, he is a virtual celebrity and his name is known by
every magical being he comes into contact with. This was a charming first book to kick off the series and I enjoyed it much more than | expected to. The characters were very
easy to picture as you read the book, and the plot was exciting enough that even if you had never heard of the movie or had an idea beforehand of what was going to happen
you would want to continue to read because the story was very well written.

10,"All of my friends and classmates were obsessed with Harry Potter as | was growing up and unfortunately, | had little interest. | enjoyed the movies but had no desire to read the
books. During quarantine, | decided to try to get back into reading and thought that I'd give Harry Potter a try. All I can say is that I'm now officially obsessed! The books are

1000x better than the movies. | can't believe what I've been missing! If you're an adult and you're undecided because you think these books are childish, I highly recommend
that you reconsider. We could all use a little magic in our lives right now!

11,"It took me a long time to choose reading this first Harry Potter book. My primary hesitation was that it is a children’s book and | wasn't sure if | wanted to invest the time. I was
also concerned about all the attention to its’ occult references.

Having finished reading it, | can honestly say that this is a really sweet, compelling story and a pleasant read. Rowling has done a fine job of building a story in the Roald Dahl
mode. You know where “certain” adults are simply irredeemably cruel, countered by a truly innocent character. In this case, an innocent Harry Potter is counterbalanced against
his cruel Aunt, Uncle and cousin.

12,"Harry Potter is just an average boy. Average...until he stops the most powerful dark wizard in a century in his tracks as a baby! Since then, the name Harry Potter is known all
through the wizarding world. Harry Potter is famous for stopping Voldemort. Harry's parents are killed by Voldemort, and Voldemort tried to kill Harry, but failed. This is why
Harry is Famous. He's the hero who stopped the dark lord.

Harry then gets drop off at his Aunt's and Uncle's house by Albus Dumbledore. Harry is less than famous at Privet Drive. In fact, he's close to being invisible in the Dursley
household. He never gets any mail, doesn't have any friends, and his life is pretty much miserable under the stairs where he lives. All that chages when Harry gets a letter from
Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Harry finds out that he is a wizard, and his parents were wizards (duh!).

And so, Harry goes to Hogwarts. There, he makes some friends (and enemies).

A great read for both kids and aldults!

13,"| got this book, Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone, after my old copy got lost during a move. | just couldn't not have this book in my book collection! The Harry Potter books
were the reason | fell in love with reading and make-believe worlds and I have JK Rowling to thank for that. The writer created a magical, wizarding world which will inevitably
give you homey and warm feelings all over; by the end of this book, you'll want to be a wizard! The book is about a young boy, Harry Potter, and his adventures in Hogwarts (a
wizarding school) after discovering he is a wizard by a very diverse, funny, warm and very big, Hagrid, the groundskeeper at Hogwarts. We're introduced to the rest of the trio,
Hermione and Ron in Hogwarts, Rowling takes us through Harry's struggles at being an orphan, a newly wizard, and famous for surviving a curse by the darkest wizard of all
times; it easily keeps you hooked! I loved the amazing character development we see with the trio, especially with Ron, who started out shy and awkward but slowly became

braver.

14,"Just started reading the Harry Potter books for the first time, and as soon as I finished this | literally said out loud to mysetf “Now I get it” lol I LOVED this. So embarrassed that |
am 24 and an avid reader and it took me so long to come around to reading these, but like | said, now I get it! | haven't even finished the series yet, but I finally understand all
the hype! These books are absolutely incredible.

15,"1am currently rereading the Harry Potter books for the first time since J. K. Rowling concluded her series. What most impressed me about the series the first time through was
how much better it got as it went along. The first two novels in the series -- THE SORCERER'S STONE and THE CHAMBER OF SECRETS -- were fun and interesting, but not great.
THE PRISONER OF AZKABAN, however, | did think qualified as great, and the subsequent books were even better. | tremendously admired Rowling in all this. I'm sure that she
had absolutely no idea that the books would become the phenomenon that they did. She could have coasted and produced several more novels on the same level as the first
two, but instead she worked extremely hard, improved her craft, and kept faith with her readers, The quality of the first novels compared with the later novels is immense.
Whether or not the series deserved the degree of hype it received early on can be debated, but by the time Rowling completed her saga it definitely warranted alll the praise that
it had received.

Nonetheless, even though THE SORCERER'S STONE is nowhere as good as the later books would be, this is a better book than | remembered. Rowling does a tremendous job of
setting up the overall situation, imbuing her story with primal elements that perfectly appeal not merely to child readers, but any reader. Many of these elements are similar to
what one finds in classic fairy tales: a child with a hidden destiny and unacknowledged worth is abused and debased by uncaring foster parents. This is as basic a set up as they
come. And the details that Rowling develops as she chronicles Harry's life with the Dursleys are exquisite. There are times when she almost goes over the top and the neglect of
the Dursleys become absurd, but all in all the effect is delightful. The contrast between Harry's nightmarish life with the Dursleys and his exciting, if sometimes dangerous, life

at Hogwarts is immense.

16,"This adventures book is about a young boy who has no knowledge of magic, sorcery, and evil encounters. Harry potter only knows of an abusing life with his selfish and
destructive aunt and uncle, and their repulsive son, Dudley. However, one winters evening harry received a letter brought by a mysterious bleached white owl, that was inviting
him to a remarkable place called Hogwarts. Harry was soon to discover a world he has never known, a world of magical experiences, and things he has only dreamed of. There

he will discover his love for magic, friends, and much more. Harry will now realize his destiny that has been awaiting hirn, but it will take a lot of strength and courage to
overcome the challenges he will face.

In this book, the experiences were as real as it could get. | felt so intrigued; | felt a connection with this novel. My personal connection to this book was with Harry's best friend,
Ron Weasley. | felt this connection because Ron is Harry's greatest friend and Ron help harry with everything, he would do anything for harry. He was an astounding friend to
everyone. Ron wasn't the most courageous but throughout the book and the series he found his bravery and showed it and became something of himself.

17,"I'm 46 and male who works out and thinks he's macho and I've read this book 4 times. If you have a stressful job like me where you car't relax, read the HP books. They put you
ina fantasy world and JK Rowling's storytelling is so unbelievable and descriptive, she's the best. | got this series for my father after my mother passed away. They were married
69 years and he was grieving, This is not his kind of book but after reminding him how much my mother loved them, he agreed to read them and agrees it puts him in another
world and helps him gain peace.

18,"| enjoyed lots of details of the book. I mostly liked how Harry lived with his mean uncle and aunt and his cousin named Dudley but then something special happens to Harry and
he finds out he is a wizard and has a mom witch and a dad wizard who died from Lord Voldemorts spell or the who must not be named. Harry goes to Hogwarts his first day and
becomes best friends with Ron and Hermione. | loved learning spells in the book. | love how Harry thinks snape is trying to kill him but then Harry finds out professor Quirrel is
teaming up with lord Voldemort. This book had great, loving quotes from Dumbledore and he taught me a lesson at the end of the book.

There was a confusing little part I didn't like about the book. | didn't like how Professor Quirrel seemed not at all suspicious but then for a suprise at the end of the book it turns
out to be Quirrel but in the movie it does point out how suspicious Quirrel is being but overall | loved the book and you should read it!

| think people who love mysterious and magic will love reading this book. For those people who dream of being a witch or wizard like me and love to memorize spells will
absolutely love this book!

19,"Iread this book when it first came out many years ago and didn’t finish it. It wasn't for me- i was YA. My grandson recently told me he hated reading- so | suggested we read a
book together. | was apprehensive about choosing HP, but | figured maybe he would enjoy it, even If | didn’t. | have to say, we are having the best time! We started the series in
February, and we read a chapter a night over Facetime. We are on Book 6 already and | am dreading finishing the series. | adore this book and admit to reading ahead after we
finish our chapter. Harry and the crew are so likable, Rowling took her own Sorting Hat- filled it with monsters and fantastic creatures and manages to pop them into each book
with delightful resutts. While | was afraid so of the plot was too dark for my eight year old- he seems not to be upset or scared, It has opened the doorway to our imagination
and we are having a wonderful bonding experience. The best thing to happen, was for my reading hating grandson to go up several levels of reading in school and insist we read
together every night. It is not only my favorite activity, but his as well. Thank you J.K. Rowling!

20,"I'm probably the only person on earth who had never read Harry Potter. I'm taking seriously Amazon's rating system in which 4 stars means ""I liked it"" and 5 stars means ""I loved
it."" | liked it. Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone was a fun read, creative, humorous, more absorbing than I expected. As someone who strongly prefers realism over fantasy, |
thought | might be bored, but | wasn't. | genuinely enjoyed the book, which had good character development and never stopped moving, But | wasn't sorry when the book
ended, and | don't plan to read the others in the series, Fantasy is just not my genre. So now I'm back to reading either historical or contemporary fiction, because | think real life

has a depth to it that fantasy cannot match.

21,"| bought this book for my 9 year old as his first “big kid” type of book. He has officially finished reading all of the Captain Underpants and Diary of a Wimpy Kid books so moving
forward I wanted him to have something that will challenge him and hold his attention. | was only slightly worried that he would get board since this will be the first book he
has read that doesn’t have any comics or doodles throughout the pages to hold interest.

Let's face it, Harry Potter needs no introduction. My book arrived in about half of my estimated shipping time in emasculate condition. My son has been reading it for about a
week now and is coming up to the halfway mark. He even woke up extra early before school the other day to get some reading in (proud mama/bookworm moment).

22,"Iwas late to the Harry Potter game, but | loved it. In this book, Harry got a letter saying he is in fact a wizard. So he is enrolled the Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.
Him, along with his new friend the giant Hagrid, go to Diagon Alley, a magical bazaar, and thus he is thrust into the magical universe so captured the imagination of millions. We
soon learn Harry is world famous among wizards for conquering an evil Wizard named Vo - um - He Who Must Not Be Named. Sorry “bout that slip. =}. The book also introduces
the relationship dynamics that would continue throughout the entire series, from the interplay between the three main kids (Harry, Ron, and Hermione), to the ambiguous
Severus Snape, the wise mentor figure of Albus Dumbledore, bumbling Hagrid with his love of nasty creatures, prim and reserved Professor McGonagall, evil incarnate
Voldemort, Draco Malfoy, etc.

Along the way, we learn that Voldemort is after a magical artifiact called the Philosopher's Stone (which was, unfortunately, changed from the UK original title to ""Sorcerer's
Stone"" in all other regions). So much of the novel is driven by the three main characters defending this stone from Voldemort. The book is engaging with its imagery, humor,
plot twists and real-life child problems. The book doesn't only appeal to children but adults as well. She's a master on fantasy. She really can, with no difficulty at all, think
herself back to 11 years old. You will love the whimsical descriptions, humorous quotes and the fun characters.

23,"Seen the movies a handful of times but decided I wanted to read the books. The movies do a good job but there are pieces that are missing or not explained that kept me not
understanding the whole story. Reading the books help to fill those gaps and I'm constantly telling my bf how stuff really went down at Hogwarts! Also there are other
characters the movies don't include and the more detail about hedwig and other creatures makes the books so enjoyable. I've read the first 3 Harry Potter book is in one month!

24,"This book is a great value! If you can afford it and don't have the hard cover books, | suggest you invest in them because they are so beautiful! | grabbed this because my
husband wanted to re-read this and I have the hardcovers at my parents house (across the country) so | figure I can pass this along to a local school when I'm done!

Iwill also say that if you or your child are dyslexic, the hardcover is also a joy to read and this would be more frustrating.
