1,"This is a story of a young boy who is left to live with his undesirous extended family after his father and mother die when he is one year old. His upbringing is not a pleasant one
but does not affect Harry Potter negatively. When Harry is older he is whisked away to a school that will teach him wizardry and help him connect to his past. While at school

Harry learns skills that help him fight an evil that is forever present. This book was full of adventure, mystery, and entertainment that pulls the reader into the story.
I rated this book 5/5 stars and highly recommend it.

I was hesitant to try it out because, the summary isn't interesting. The only good thing that happens to Harry is attending Hogwarts. What made me read it was | read
something that she spent 17 years designing the world. (While | found that cool at first-don't get me wrong; it's still is-that's probably because the novel got rejected about 12
times.) Until the fourth or fifth chapter, the Dursleys sucked the fun out of reading it. Later on, the main protagonist made it unpleasant to read. | was going to give this two
stars until | read part of the biography. | usually wouldn't care ,but J.K. Rowling said “the idea fell into her head”. I'm not against getting inspiration from other authors, but she's
essentially trying to pretend The Worst Witch doesn't exist. (Not only has the book series been around since the 70s, but once this came out, that got pushed under the rug.)
The only two characters | really like are Scabbers and Snape. Scabbers got thrown up against a train window, but he just went back to sleep. | like Snape because, he didn't feel
as though he had to be nice to Harry just because Voldemort didn't kill him. (Then again, that was due to his father so | doubt my own argument a little bit.) 'm glad they just
agreed to say Voldemort towards the end. It got annoying and repetitive to read You-Know-Who.

British household and then gradually move into an enchanting world full of excitement, fun and even danger! Poor Harry Potter, trapped with his relatives, the Durdsleys who
make him sleep under the stiars while their own son has two bedrooms. Then one day he starts receiving letters which they do not allow him to read, However everytime they
throw them out the next day more an more keep appearing, under the door, down the chimmney, through the window. Harry finally discovers that he has been admitted to the

And then came the story. I wanted so badly to run away screaming, but the shock had taken the breath out of me, and my feet had fallen asleep from this dreadful story. It had
no virtue, no truth, no reason, no sense, no NOTHING!

I wanted to destroy the memory of it any way possible. But there will be no turning back from this. This is why children cry; why dogs lick themselves; why the rivers run

31,"So this is Harry Potter. After hearing about the boy wizard for thirteen years, this feels like reading a biography. | know the name and some of the exploits, but | don't know the
details.

Potter, like so many great protagonists, exhibits unusual potential for his age, combined with a gentle humility and loyalty to his friends. What Potter hasn't shown, so far, is
weakness, or acknowledgement of weakness, (Harry's comparative lack of book smarts, when put alongside Hermione, hardly counts as a character weakness.) Harry is
compelling for his potential, but he's distant in his lack of humanity. There aren't any weaknesses or flaws to be seen, and he seems to excel out of a fixed destiny rather than
any real effort on his part. So far, Harry is intriguing but not inspiring.

32,"This was actually the second time I'd read Book One. | read it when it first came out. It was still very entertaining, even years later. | was never bored, not once, and even though |
knew what was going to happen, it was so much like visiting with old friends, that didn’t bother me.

My only complaint, and it is minor, is that some of the writing is a bit awkward, Ms. Rowling got much better as the series ran on, but her early efforts were a tad amateurish.

All that aside, Ms. Rowling deserves the accolades she’s received. The POTTER series is a massive accomplishment, highly entertaining, incredibly creative, and a whole lot of fun!

always evil aunt and uncle??? Why the little victim is always the “super special boy""? It's a okay book for little kids to have fantasy about magic, spells, etc. But the depth ideas
are not as heathly as the surface - a little special boy learnt magic. When you read the book to your kids, please pay attention to the negative ideas regarding the aunt and uncle

issue.

34,"I honestly, don't get the hubub about the series. I've seen a few of the movies and now I've read the first book and all | can see that's interesting about it is that it sparks
imaginative minds with it's mythology and it's characters are well formed. Maybe I needed to be on board from the beginning so that | could get caught up in the mystery. |
think that was one of the problems with reading this book now. | already knew everything that was going to happen. There was no surprise, no suspense, no mystery left.

But even if | hadn't already seen the movie and known the plot, | think the mystery was a little too simple. | mean, seriously, ""what's in the small brown package?!"" Oh, wait, let

with Voldamort'’s evil accomplice Quirrel to get the stone and him becoming immortal.3 The book was pretty good but not really that is just my opinion and other people have

thought | might be bored, but | wasn't. | genuinely enjoyed the book, which had good character development and never stopped moving, But | wasn't sorry when the book

idea just how bad it could be until | bought the electronic version of the audiobook earlier today. I've spent the last six hours on the phone with Mayday, their specialist
department, Audiblebooks, and even Barnes and Noble trying to get it onto my KindleFire, but it was no use. Pottermore claims on its website that it is ""compatible with all

48,"There has been a lot of fuss about “satanic” elements in the Harry Potter novels, so | was careful to read this book before passing it along to my nephew as a Christmas gift.
Frankly, | didn't find any reason for concern: the book is very much in the tradition of such children's classics as Baum's Oz novels, which have featured witches, sorcerers, goblins
and the like without ever once being accused of satanic overtones.

The major difference between such as the Oz books and Harry Potter is that Ozand others like it--are set in a completely imaginary world, while Harry Potter is not. While this
is probably the very thing that its detractors find most upsetting, it is actually the very thing that makes the book so much fun to read, for its fantasy elements take ona literal
quality that allow for the willing suspension of disbelief in a way not previously seen in books written for children. It is a very sophisticated bit of writing, and I look forward to
reading the other books in the series myself.

These are not, by the way, books written for young children. Most six and seven year olds will be completely out of their depth. They are more appropriate to the ten-year-old
and over crowd, who will have less difficulty reading them on their own.

| experienced made me realize that the entire time | was reading the story, it was screaming at me the real answer. It was set up like any great psychological story dropping all

Having finished reading it, | can honestly say that this is a really sweet, compelling story and a pleasant read. Rowling has done a fine job of building a story in the Roald Dahl

a PHd would enjoy made me believe it was a safe bet. This book was very disappointing to say the least. The writing is average and | would love to know where those PHd
readers received their degrees from. The one star rating is in proportion to the hype this book received and the disappointment I felt while reading it. The writing isn’t bad and
the story is entertaining and if | had read it without ever hearing anything about it my rating would be higher and | probably would have enjoyed it a little more. Still, this was a

written, quite boring and surprisingly derivative. It wouldn't take a fantasy fan long to come up with a list of the sources of most of the ideas in the book. How anyone can call it
original is beyond me. Maybe I've just read too much of the much superior source stuff (like Roald Dahl and Terry Pratchett). However | can understand its appeal as its blends
Enid Blyton and Adrian Mole into the cauldron of fantasy ficton and therein lies its only shred of originality. However I've been told the books get better so I'm reserving final

While the narrator was great, and it was nice to hear how everything was supposed to be pronounced, the story was just ok. I've seen the movies with my husband, and |
couldn't find many discrepancies. They're nearly identical - and | usually prefer any book over its movie adaptation, hands down. | honestly fell asleep every time | tried to listen
to the book, and then had to go back and find where | last listened, the next time | came back to it.

Well, | didn't really care for the first movie so maybe that’s why my opinion on the book is the same. | was curious to read it and find out all the things people say the movie

lost interest, then was again pressured by others insisting how good it is. I started over, making notes of all the problems as I went through. This is a really poorly conceived
""world"" by the standards of the high fantasy genre...pretty much incoherent. Readers are expected to accept things merely because the author says so, even though they don't
feel plausible. About every chapter or two there is something absurd that readers simply have to try to shrug off or ignore. For example, Harry uses an alarm clock to wake
himself up, but then does everything else ""quietly"" so as to sneak around one morning without awakening anyone else. Sorry, but you just used an ALARM CLOCK! The movie
fixed most of the worst howlers, thank goodness, such as the utterly absurd scene with Hermione “inconspicuousty* using magic during a crowded stadium Qidditch match while
bumping into people and knocking a professor down. We're just supposed to accept absurd contrivances and things that make so sense.

60,"That | am just now reading the Harry Potter series would surprise no one who knows me. I'm usually a good 3-5 years behind trend. Harry Potter has legions of adoring fans and
noted detractors, who are in turn drowned out by the passion of Harry Potter fans. | understood nothing of HP before | read my first book, which was ironically book three:
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban. After reading the first book I'm now proud to say that | am a fan, maybe not to the extent that some people are, since I've largely
missed being on the ten year journey of most Potter fans. I'm also living proof that you can still get something out of the books, even if the wave has driven past you.

61,"| read this book for two reasons. My 13 year old granddaughter asked me to and | wanted to be able to tell every HP fan who asked that | had read one. | have never cared for
fantasy or science fiction so take this review with a grain of salt but | found it pretty forgettable.

62,"The letters are so small that | am unable to read it to my granddaughter. Also the cover is very flimsy.

63,"I'm so weary of ""Rowling Can Do No Wrong"" reviews. Whether you liked it or not, you must admit that the names Muggles and Harry Potter were found originally in the works of
“The Legend Of RAH And The Muggles"" and other works by Nancy K Stouffer, | haven't read her book yet, but feel it necessary to share this because of the censorship of truth by
those in power. | have no axe to grind, just a desire for truth.

64,"I love the Harry Potter books. | have read through the series quite a few times. So | decided to get the books. This book was in great shape. However, on the back, there was not
a background picture, just a blank color. Not a big deal, just kinda disappointing
",positive
65,"| cannot say that loved this book. Long after the Harry Potter hype I wanted to understand what the fuss was all about. | am sure there is some merit to all the madness but for
me it was a slower and drawn out read but only from about the time Harry Potter entered the school of Hogwort academy. Predictably, Harry meets his friends (Hermione and
Ron) whom will soon have to combat some opposing evil forces which may mean either witch's that perform ""dark arts"" or bullies and faculty members.

66,"If |were twelve, this book would rate five stars. This is because it is a fine children's book, and Rowling must be given credit for constructing the perfect fantasy for a twelve
year-old. Harry is alone, neglected, unloved, and misunderstood; these are feelings that come naturally at that age. Harry's cousin is odious, spoiled, and pampered by his
adoptive aunt and uncle, while he is mistreated terribly, Who among us has not felt at least once that a sibling was favored over us?

But Harry is also something special, as all twelve year-olds want to be. He has special powers, and he is rescued from those who do not appreciate him by a magical fantasy
world where not only are all his needs met, but where he has a great destiny, where even the oldest and wisest know his name and power. Verigeance is exacted on the foolish
“muggles"" in the form of a tail being placed on his fat, spoiled cousin, and the terrible aunt and uncle are humiliated before him by a rescuer who is utterly loyal and
overwhelmingly powerful. Adventure and exciternent follow.

68,"So the book came really fast, which is good since | lost this one from the set. The sad thing, though, was opening the box and finding a mashed corner. Two books were tossed in
the box and absolutely nothing in there with them. It looks more like the book got crunched in the upper left hand comer of the front before it was even in the box. | was
dismayed but it's not enough to bother sending back a paperback. Just a bit disappointing.

69,"While | was on a bus trip to NYC in November of 2001, only a few months after 9/11 for a college school credit one of the passengers on the bus had the book. So | didn't waste
any of my own money, thank god. | read a few pages and my eyes, along with every other part of my being, refused to attempt any more than that. It was the worst writing |
had come across at the time, | have since come across worse writing that is of course being heralded as an amazon five star as well. | don't understand the type of mind that
could enjoy this, nor do | want to try to be honest. | honestly feel there must be some mind control at play that I'm very immune to.

70,"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is the first book in a series of seven that tells the story of a young boy who is orphaned as a baby when his parents are killed by a dark
wizard who tries to kill Harry too, but Harry survives the attack and all he is left with is a scar on his forehead that identifies him as the only living wizard known to be able to
survive Voldemort. After the attack as a baby is sent to live with his human or ""muggle"" relatives where for ten years, he is never told he is a wizard; and he receives harsh and
cold treatment from them because they desperately want to fit into the ""normal"" world and Harry is anything but ordinary.

71,"Really? Compared to everything else out there, this book just isn't that great. Granted I'm not in second grade but there are so many better stories and way better writers. If it
keeps your kids reading - great. But if they really want good books you should be steering them to better books.

If the Never-ending Story and the Phantom Tollbooth are 5's this book is not even close.

72,"Harry Potter might be a great book for children. But I'm not a child and | won't judge it on that basis, and since so many adults have read it as book for adults. I just don't get the
fuss. And it’s not as though | don't like fantasy. | loved The Lord of the Rings, The Chronicles of Thomas Covenant, The Neverending Story, The Chroniclers of Narnia and my
other fantasies. It might be just a small matter, but since such a big fuss is made about Quiditch, or whatever it's called, then take a little time to come up with a scoring system
that makes sense. All the other players on the team are flying around and trying to score points. But their points mean absolutely nothing. The only point of the game was Harry
versus his rival, All the other players on both teams were irrelevant. How stupid can you get? That said, | actually did enjoy the movies, though they don't come close to The Lord

of the Rings.

73,"I missed the fad. The mania known as Harry Potter. A coworker couldn't believe | hadn't read any of the Harry Potter books (he told me it is his favorite book series ever outside
of Tolkien) and convinced me to pick up the first one. He did warn me that the first 2 are much more kid friendly and that the 3rd one is where it starts to bring in some of the
darkness and more adult themes that make up the latter books.

seller, | have just learned my lesson in purchasing a used book, Not the sellers! fault. | have no problems with the seller. They did try to replace the first one, and when the
second one still wasn't good in my opinion, | knew it wasn't their fault. Thank You Seller for trying.
