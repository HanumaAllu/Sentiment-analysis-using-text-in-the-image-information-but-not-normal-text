0,"Iwas skeptical about this flat iron even though it had great reviews because a lot of the reviews here seem to be from people who got a discount to review. I did not get any
discount for this review so it's completely unbiased and have to say | am in LO V E with this flat iron. I'm an African-mixed Latina with type 4a natural hair that is transitioning
from relaxers and I can get my hair salon-quality straight and my hair looks amazing! It moves, it’s shiny, with minimal breakage and is straight all the way to the roots!

1,"For fairness | will start out by saying that | am not a hair product snob. Before | bought this product, | owned a $20 Conair flat iron | bought at WalMart in 2005. (I didn't use it
much any more and I could hear my hair crying in agony when I did.) At the time | bought this, my every day hair routine was to blow dry with a round brush and hope for the
best. I was often disappointed with my appearance by mid-morning. Then | bought this.

As for the quality of the product: I've used it nearly every day for the last 6 months and it shows no visible wear, It opens and closes smoothly and the plates slide through my
hair easily. | have not used the heat glove or the argan oil so | will not comment.

2,"I really wish I'd spent the money on a better product rather than trying to save a few bucks by buying this. The cord of my kipozi straightener was damaged recently so | needed
a new one, but this...even on the same temp setting as my old straightener (as best | can tell, anyway, given that it's a fiddly little dial with literally no indicators of temp aside
from the top and bottom ends of the range - hope you like guessing what temp you've just set it at!}, it cannot stay hot between passes to save its life. With my old straightener,
| only needed to pause for a second or two between passes to let it regain any heat lost on the previous go, and even after several passes in quick succession over adjacent
segments | still needed to be careful about touching my hair too quickly after the iron touched it. This thing needs a minimum of 5-10 seconds between passes. | used to set my
kipozi to 380 degrees; I've got this one tured to about 400-41 0ish I think? But at best it leaves my hair feeling warmish, and slightly less unruly than before, but it's definitely
not coming out anything like straight unless | spend half an hour on it, with 10 second pauses in between every...single...stroke... And I'm sorry but ain't nobody got time for
that. I'm going to have to eat the sunk cost on this and go buy something actually quality.
",positive
3,"The temperature control is a small dial on the inside of the iron. It is small and hard to read with only 3 temps listed so you are guessing as to the exact temp it is set at. There's
no digital display. | also didn't think it was any smoother than my 5 year old, less expensive current flat iron.

4,"I've been ironing my hair for so long | actually started doing it before flat irons were invented ! This iron heats up so fast and works so much better than the name brand one |
just tossed out. Buy it you will not be sorry!
",positive
5,"Just not what | expected or wanted. I've been using a very high end flat iron, and the first time this one pinched my hand...well that was it for me. It gets hot fast and all that but
watch your grip it will pinch the s#% out of ya.

6,"Ihave used this almost daily for 4 years and it still holds up great. You would think that using a hair iron daily would eventually darnage my hair, but my hair is still very healthy.
From day one to today, this iron still provides shine and removes frizziness. | have always bought salon grade hair straighteners because | have curly hair. | bought this because
the one I had prior finally died and | was on a tight budget. This product has held up in comparison.

7,"| found this to large and long for my small hands. It appears to be a nice product. But since | had to return before | could use, | don't know how well it would perform.
",negative
8,"General comment: | had my previous flat iron for almost 8 years. As much as | paid for it, | expected it to last longer, but what ended up malfunctioning on it was the on-off
switch. It started going on the fritz about a year ago. The work-around was for me to keep it in the on position all the time, and simply plug it into the wall outlet when | wanted
to use it, and unplug it when I was done. This worked most of the time for awhile - although | often had to gently jiggle the switch back & forth (sometimes for up to 30
seconds) to get it to connect. Since the on-off switch was already faulty, even this eventually failed, and nothing | did could get it ""on."" A friend who's an electrical engineer
examined it and told me most on-off switches are poorly made and will typically fail after being used enough times. He said the best solution in engineering scenarios is to wire
around the on-off mechanism, bypassing it altogether. Short of this electrical feat, he confirmed leaving the switch turned to the on position and plugging and unplugging the
electrical cord from the outlet will minimize these switch failures. That's what I've been doing and will continue to do with this HSI Pro.

9,"| bought this for an upcoming international trip, so | got this one in the dual voltage option. It doesn't hold a candle to my Kristen Ess flat iron that | use a few times a week, but
it does a good enough job for my purpose (international trips). | don't think it heats to 450 though. Doing a side by side | got the same results at this one’s 450 as I did on my
Kristen Ess at 365 (my go to setting ). It also pulls my hair just a enough to notice that it's doing that. I had to run it through my stubborn, wiry grays at my roots more times
than | am used to doing. I'd say it's good for the price. The build feels nice, although | prefer longer plates. But overall it’s fine.

10,"Iwas in between relaxers when a stylist trimmed and straightened my hair as if she relaxed it. | just had to know what she did. She told me she flat ironed my hair. Wonderful! |
went to Amazon and searched. I saw quite a few good reviews about the HSI ceramic flat iron and made the purchase. | was hoping | would receive the flat iron before my next
wash. Sure enough! I received the iron and it was securely packaged. | was pleasantly surprised at how quick the flat iron heated up...love that! Using the flat iron on a small
section of my hair was okay, but not as straight as I would get with the curling iron. | raised the heat, waited for about 5 seconds and went over the same section. Still not right.
raised it midway, waited about 5 seconds, and this time | got the effect | was looking for. That section of my hair was not only straight, but it also had a silky shine. | like the fact
that when | increased the temp, | didn't have to wait a time for the iron to reach the higher temp. This is my first flat iron purchase and | have not tried anything else to compare,

but | am quite pleased with this purchase, especially with the way this baby heats up!
",positive
11,"| only write reviews when a product is really, really bad or really, really awesome! This straightener is amazing for its low price. | almost didn't purchase after reading some of the
reviews because | have really long and thick hair. It takes me forever to dry and straighten my hair. | always purchase top of the line blow dryers and straighteners. In the recent
years I've used the Chi straightener and the L’Ange and both were disappointing for the money and how long they lasted. If straighteners only last a year | figured I'd buy a less
expensive one this time and replace it and not be out much money.
",positive
12,"My 6mo old flatiron died, so I went back to the HSI that has served me well in the past. | gave it a 4. on temp control, because it is inside and harder to see. HSI has always had
good heat for my thick curly hair. Hope this one lasts as long as my others have!
",positive
13,"Let me start by saying that | have only left a review for two things | have purchased on Amazon. | am a huge advocate for researching a product and I rely a lot on customer

reviews, So here goes:

I have always used a professional salon flat iron. When my GHD (professional model 200+ dollar) flat iron overheated and burned a giant chunk of my hair off (it even burned
out my new haircolor) and then made a terrifying popping and burning noise, | immediately tossed it in the trash. | was distressed because I did not have the money to spend on
another $200+ flat iron, so | was doing without while I saved to buy another ""professional"" flat iron. and THEN...... my friend, who is a stylist, sent me the link to this product on
Amazon. | was skeptical, but hey.... Amiazon has a superb return policy and what harm could it do right? and for $39.0077?? It was certainly worth trying.

 
",positive
14,"Wow! With all these glowing reviews, | think | expected a miracle product! | think it's maybe OK at best. I did like the way my hair looked the first couple times | used it. Then |
realized my hair was splitting and started looking burned, My hair is thick and naturally curly and was very healthy. | wish it showed the temp, instead of the little dial that is
very hard to see and in a bad spot. | returned it.
",positive
15,"This flat iron is amazing! It took me from post-blow out (first picture) to smooth and sleek (second picture}. | don't feel that it damaged my hair at all- it more so kept the
moisture of my heat protectant and soaked it in. My hair is 3c in texture for reference. It even helped my split ends lay down without an issue!

| only gave it 4 stars for the fact that it doesn’t have a temperature display, only the dial. In other words, it doesn’t show you numbers of what temperature you have it set on. |
dislike that because | like to know just how hot | have it, but that’s okay. All buttons and switches are tucked away inside so | don’t run the risk of accidentally bumping
something and turning it off. Overall, | absolutely love it!
",positive
16,"I've had this for three months. | like it but there are a couple of things I'm not a fan of. It doesn’t automatically shut off. If you forget to leave it on, then it’s on all day. The heat
setting is a dial. There is no digital display or visual of what setting it’s truly on. | will say that it does not snag my hair, which is a problem I've had with previous brands, Hope
this helps!!
",positive
17,"I love this! 've had it for almost 20 months now. It's a very good alternative to high end flat irons. I've used Croc, CHI, and plenty of crappy Walmart flat irons. This one is not the
BEST but it is very good. My hair is thin, frizzy, and | have a lot of it. It heats up very fast and evenly, which is great. | love the adjustable temps. | use almost the highest one. It
takes more than a few passes to get it perfectly pin straight (I also use a straightening comb, the kind that is shaped like a flat iron) but if you don't care about that, then this is
perfect. I'd say it takes one pass to just smooth down an area, two passes to get it straight, and three passes to get it PIN straight. It’s also good for touch-ups, bangs, and adding
waves/curls by flicking your wrist. It has never snagged my hair and ripped them out.

18,"I've had this since 2016 and use it two to three times a week. It still works great, but if it dies tomorrow, | will order the same one again.
Paying more for one of those name brands the beauty shops sell is a waste of money.
I have curly/wavy hair that is very fine, so | use it on the mid heat setting and get fantastic results every time.

20,"I had my old Corioliss flat iron for over 12 years. Someone had used it on my hair at a mall- people still went to malls in 2008- and told me it cost $150, so | found it on eBay for
$40. I was super proud of myself because finding things cheaper online was barely a thing back then. And it was brilliant until it met its match with European plug sockets. |
think it would've lived forever otherwise. RIP :(

Interestingly, it actually had the Exact same body as this HSI one. The only physical differences are the old on-light was red and this one’s green and the ceramic plates were
gold instead of black, Even the temperature dial is the same. That's why | picked this one- | thought the quality would be the exact same or probably better!
",positive
21,"Well it is not a one pass flat iron like a lot of people say. | have long coarse hair. | also don't think it gets as hot as it advertised. However after several passes through my hair |
can get it straight to the point it's not a frizzy mess. | have to use a straightening balm to help with that. Overall it's better than some of the other flat irons | have but it’s not
the best either.

22,"When I received the first one, | used it a couple of times, both with the oil and without. | HATED it. | felt like it was pulling, or catching, my hair. | could not understand the
reviews, Amazon contacted me and | told them | was not happy with it and what it was doing. They said it sounded like | might have received a defective product and they were
willing to ship out a replacement. | accepted and was looking forward to getting it. The nice thing is, the one they replaced it with had the digital heat display and a different
plug. | travel often and hated the big box plug that was on the original one. | was excited to try the new one. It heated up quickly and the color display helped to indicate that it
was ready. | used it. No hair snag! The hair went through nice and smooth. | have used this straightener many times since. | have tried it with the oil and without. As | stated in
my review about the oil, | didn't see a difference. As for the straightener itself, it's OK. | had a 2"" inexpensive one from Wal-Mart prior to this one. | really don't see what everyone
loves about this one. It works, | hate the smaller size, but I knew that when | purchased it. My hair is extremely thick, long, and course. Even taking the smaller size into account
and doing much smaller chunks of hair, | feel like | have to pass through the hair more than once truly straighten it. | have tried doing the soft curls with it, | can do it with the
shorter pieces in the front but the sides and back, even taking small clumps, it just doesn't seem to really want to curl it.

Bottom line, do | love it? No. Do | hate it? No Because of the compact size, it travels nicely. | will probably purchase a different one with a larger plate to use at home. | don't see
myself purchasing this brand again.
",positive
23,"This iron is not as magical as | expected after all of the glowing reviews, but it’s decent. | was pleased to see the insulated travel pouch it comes with (I do think the glove is
overkill, I've never met a flat iron that didn't go up to 400F so it's nothing special in that regard), and the argan oil is a nice touch although I'm not much for using oil in my hair.

Build quality is a bit suspect. The temperature control is primitive at best and unless you have it cranked all the way up, it's a crapshoot as far as guessing the actual degree of
heat. It does heat up quickly, though. Indicator light on the bottom is kind of weird, but mostly irrelevant. Long cord is a plus, particularly for traveling purposes when it's very
possible to be faced with an unsavory distance between outlet and mirror. Dual voltage also a huge plus, | wouldn't have bought this if it weren't.

24,"lam African American and | have been trying to transition from perms to natural hair, but straight natural hair. | used to use a Remington hair straightener and it worked okay
for the most part but for some reason my hair never shined the way | wanted it. | was looking at getting a CHI but then | came across HSI and decided to research a bit more
before I made the purchase. | am super glad | decided to take a chance on this straightener because | have never, ever had straight hair without having to use a perm and to be
honest my hair never tock to perms that well either. My hair is about 8 inches and kind of coarse when not permed and my new growth is especially hard to straighten because
the hair is super coarse and curly. | used this for the first time tonight and | had straight hair on one pass. | will tell you what | used on my hair to get a perm look without the

chemical!

25,"| ordered this flat iron because it provides the heat | need to get my silk press right! I'm glad | purchased it, well worth the money and does exactly what I need it to do. Makes

26,"I received mine two days ago. | LOVE the oil and the flat iron! It heats up quickly and works in an incredible way! | have my own way of straightening my hair. | use a J&D Heat
Straight Brush and the flat iron at the same time. | would clamp my hair and have the flat iron above it... then I go downward. The brush will keep your hair straight and
separated for the flat iron to heat it nicely.

The location of the temp. knob and on/off switch is not something people like but | think it's good. Because our hand is constantly slipping on the outside, we might switch it off
or tun up/down the heat on accident. | wished it came with two gloves because | couldn't decide which hand | should use it for. The straightener is hot and so is the hair. | used
it on my straighter hand since the iron will ALWAYS be hot while your hair will cool down quick. The iron heats very quick. Mine reached max temp. in under a minute. The cord is
workable. The argan oil is great. The pouch it comes with is awesome and thick.

27,"I wanted to like this straightener and | don’t know if | got a defective one but it did NOT heat up fast at all. When it did finally get warm it wasn’t hot enough to even straighten
that well. My hair is 3c/4a and it doesn’t take much to straighten it. So with that said this not working on MY hair is saying something. | have tried to straighten my hair 2x since
receiving it. It just does not work as well as my old straightener.

28,"| bought my first Straightener 5 years ago and it was a Conair. | had never used a straightener before and at the time, it seerns to do well. But after years of using it, it felt like it
would straighten my hair but hours later my hair would not be that straight anymore. And after | straightened it, my hair seems oily or not soft. My friend has the in-styler and
my hair felt better with that but | did not want to pay that much for a straightener. | found this on amazon and saw many videos and read many reviews. My hair is damaged
from heat so | had stopped straightening it for a while. My friend recommended using Argon oil. | have been using Argon oil for months. | use Organix. So | decided on buying
this straightener because everyone said it was amazing and better then chi and the in-styler. When it came, it did come with a heat glove, the straightener in the red sleeve, and
little Argon Oil packet. | thought when it said “travel size"" that you could use it maybe about 5 times and it had a lid, But it is a packet you cut or tear. The oil does make my hair
really soft! | plugged in the HSI and it took about 5 minutes to heat. | was so excited to use it because every time i straighten my hair, it never stays or it does not even straighten
all the way. After straightening, | noticed that my hair is softer feeling then my old straightener. That is a plus. But it still does not straighten the ends of my hair. It curves. |am
not sure if that is because my hair is semi-dead or not. It still takes a few tries to straighten one part of my hair. | was hoping like one stroke through. | guess you can curl your
hair with this straightener too but Have not figured that out yet. | do recommend this straightener but | feel like it is like every other straightener out there. Nothing special. |
have only used it 3 times. | will update more if something comes up. My hair is a medium length curly, wavy, frizzy hair if you are wondering. :)

29,"| really really like it, but I can't say love for a couple reasons, which may be enough to discourage other buyers.

What | love -
Quick Heat - This is a powerful little straightener that heats up ina matter of a minute or two, and | LOVE the indicator light that lets you know it’s ready to go! Right on the flip

side of that, | think it kinda lies, and says it's ready before it really is. Sometimes I notice that the light is green far before the strongest heat is being put out.

30,"I have a short bob haircut and it is hard to find tools that work well with that length. This is great to straighten and for waves. Can't beat it for the price. | will be interested to

31,"The heat controlling plates on the outside of the straightener. It still gets hot, but not hot enough to burn my hand if | accidentally grab too high on the straightener or touch
my hand on the wrong side trying to pick it up. I've only been using it for about a month, but | feel like it’s safe to say that | see many less bums in my future, if any, that |
experienced with my old straightener.

Other reviewers are right, it doesn’t pull my hair, or very little. I never noticed how much my old straightener did it, and now I'm horrified at how long | dealt with that thing. |

how it straightens my hair and the controllable heat setting. My hair was straight for the most part. But still a little Puffy. | have thick , curl hair and when straighten it looks nice

35,"| bought this straightener 2 months ago and was waiting to write a review so | could test it out longer. | uploaded a picture of my natural air dried hair as well and another after |
straightened it and one when I flipped the straightener while using it to create soft curls. My natural hair is curly and frizzy, so | first use a blow dry brush from revlon with my
hair products and then | use this after my hair is dry. With my hair type | feel like | get the best result that way. | really like this straightener and have owned chi irons before this
and | feel like it is similar, if not a bit better. And this is cheaper so if | can find something that works the same as another product, then I'm all for it! | also flip the iron while
running it through my hair to give it soft curls. This doesn’t have a temperature display, it’s just a dial but that doesn’t bother me cause there’s not an exact temperature |
normally use on my hair. | usually set mine to around 400 because of my hair type and | feel like it smooths out the frizz better that way. (Always use a heat protectant of
course}. | wish that this one had automatic shut off, cause I have accidentally left it on the whole day on top of my wood table. It didn’t burn anything though fortunately and
nothing smelled burt when I came back home. Now | am ordering a heat resistant mat to prevent any disasters from happening, Haven't noticed any damage since I've been
using this and | feel like it does make my hair look more shiny after | use it. Also make sure to register your iron with the card that comes inside the box, to validate the warranty.
",positive
36,"At high temperatures, this straightener is pretty great. My bangs get straight in no time, and stay that way for at least a day. There's no frizz and my hair doesn't ever get caught,
which was a big must for me. However, it still takes ages to get the rest of it straight, and the wavier parts by my crown don't get straight no matter what. And forget about

using this at a lower temperature setting - nothing happens unless it's more than 3/4 of the way to the maximum. But that being said, it was cheap and it works to straighten
my bangs.

| do wonder about the product's authenticity - the sticker warning attached to the outlet plug has some ungrammatical English - ""If it does not turn on. Press firmly on reset
button"". I would expect that a real $200 straightener would pay closer attention to its labels. Also, while the box has a picture of a small glass jar of Argan oil, what was actually
contained in the box was a one-use sealed pouch. So that was a bit disappointing, although many of the reviewers said they'd found the same thing. So for $40 this was a good
purchase, but I'm sure there are much better straighteners out there. This one hasn't revolutionized my life or anything like the positive reviews made me think it would.

37,"This is a great flat iron. It straightens my, thick, relaxed hair in “one pass*...on medium temp. | don't have to ""stall"" the iron on my hair. Just one quick pass and my hair is straight.
This baby gets hot. If | used on the high setting, my hair would be scorched, but for super thick or extremely curly natural textured hair this flat iron will get hair straight quickly
and efficiently on the higher settings.

The temperature control knob/on-off button are located inside of this flat iron. The temperature control knob doesn’t have numeric temperature markings, except at the highest
and lowest settings, but it is easy to gauge the temperature ranges best suited for your hair type. For first time users, | would recommend starting at the low temp and gradually
increasing to temperature best suited for your hair type.

38,"When | am going to buy a product, | always make sure | do my research first. | keep careful and detailed accounts of the pros and cons of each specific product | look at, and |
continue to refer to my lists until | have narrowed my choices down to what | believe to be the best products for the best value. In this case, the HSI Professional straightener
won in each and every category | was researching. When the straightener came in the mail a few days after | ordered it, | was extremely excited to try it out. It came with a knit-
glove, a silk carrying case, and a trial-sized bottle of argon oil - something | had never tried before, but soon fell in love with. I also was not disappointed when it came to the
straightener itself. The conclusion I came to after my research rang true - this straightener worked even better than | was expecting. To be honest, I'd never used any kind of
styling tool on my hair before, so | was a little nervous about using it for the first time, but those fears were unfounded. This tool could not be easier to use. It has a swivel cord,
so it doesn't get tangled up with your hands as you're using it, which definitely cuts back on the time it takes to style your hair. The heat setting ranges from 140 degrees F to
400 degrees F, giving you control over how much heat you are applying to your hair and making this the perfect tool for all hair types. I have very long, very thick hair, so |
generally turn the heat up all the way and can finish styling in about ten-fifteen minutes. You have every right to be impressed by that; | know I was, My hair has never looked
better - it’s controlled, it’s smooth, it's silky...1 had been thinking about just chopping my hair off because of how unmanageable it had become, but thanks to my HSI Ino longer
have to. The plates are ceramic and do not extend, something | personally prefer, because | feel it makes it easier to style your hair when the plates dor't slide up and down as
you're working. I'm also impressed by how cool the tool stays - the handle doesn't get hot at all. | use the glove provided on the hand that’s going to touch my hair, because for
the first couple minutes after running the straighter through, your hair will maintain the temperature of the plates.

front a few times in between washes as well to style or “flip"" my hair, I wore my hair straight for about 3 months flat ironing every two weeks and only suffered heat damage in

goodness this tool didn't give me any issues. This flat iron works extremely well. No fly aways, no frizz. I was actually surprised with the low cost that it did as well as my
expensive daily one | use at home. Would recommend.

45,"Reviews on this were overall pretty good. I needed a new flat iron mostly cause the plates on my old one were pretty worn. The plates on this one were good, and hair slid
through easily, But on max temp, it still wasn’t warm enough for me. | have thinner brown hair, slightly wavy and it didn't do the job unless | ysed tiny hair pieces. If your hair can
straighten on a medium to low heat, it may be just fine for you, but not for me. The controls ate Nasir, just on/off switch snd a knob for temp control. No numbers/guide to
know what heat setting it is at, no light indicator that the tool is on, no safety turn off/auto off switch. For me I had to return it and go back to looking.

46,"this flat iron is the great product. | did not give a 5 star review was because there is no display or indicator for the temperature you are setting to, you have to guess it. Other
than that, it is a great production, the ceramic plates make my hair very smooth, and it's light weighted, very easy to use. Plus it comes with a travel pouch and glove to protect
your hand from the heat.

47,"| do like this hair straightener and hope it lasts longer than 2 years. It heats up fast and does a good job on my hair. The reason it lost a star is because it doesn't have automatic
shut off and honestly if | would have known that it didn’t | would have bought a different brand. Just the peace of mind knowing it will turn off if | forgot to is huge. I forgot the
other day and it was on for almost 5 hrs before | noticed it.

48,"Wasn't sure whether to choose 3 or 4 stars. This straightener is not bad, but it's definitely no professional styler. You do seern to get what you pay for in *most” cases. | decided
to purchase this one on Amazon after reading reviews. | wanted to see if a cheaper flat iron could do the job okay. I'd previously had a T3 and a Chi from ebay. The T3 worked
really well. I'm not sure if it was legit or not, but I don't think it was b/c when I sent in the warranty card it came back as undeliverable. The problem with the T3 was that the
hinge was really weak and kept breaking. | gorilla glued it 3 times, but after the 4th it just wouldn't hold anymore. The Chi worked decently as well, but definitely was not legit.
After those experiences with ebay and not being able to afford full price for a legit straightener | chose this one.

It works better on my hair when I've let it air dry for some reason. | don't really like the edges that grip b/c it feels like it's damaging my hair. The nice part about the gripping

edges is that the hair doesn't slip out easily as it did with the T3. I pretty much had to put the HSI on the hottest setting to straighten my hair, but it still wasn't as good as the
T3 in getting nice, sleek tresses.

49,"I just keep touching it!! My HSI professional straightener just arrived this morning. I have a cheapo flat iron that | use infrequently due to the amount of damage it does to my
hair, My hair is fine but prolific and naturally curly. One of the things I noticed right away with the HSI is that there was no hair on the floor after I straightened (with my old iron
there was a LOT of hair afterward). This makes me happy.

50,"Heats up fast is one of the best features. Occasionally it clips my fingers ouch. | wish there was a lock to keep the wand part shut when riot in use like more expensive models
instead just a piece of plastic wrap that will eventually rip. The part that heats up to straighten hair seems a little narrow, it could be a little wider but this is the first time using a
flat iron.

51,"After 12 1/2 years with my previous straightener it died! | was so sad and did a lot of research on what's out there now. | saw all of the glowing reviews and was skeptical but
thought for the price it was worth a shot. It heated up quickly like my previous one which | love (forever running late over here!) it glides through my hair quickly and smoothly
without snagging (another must have feature for me!) | loved that my hair didn’t feel or look fried after! It stayed straight! | went to the beach, it was about 84 | rode rides my
hair was flowing! | woke up the next morning expecting to be puff daddy's distance cousin with fluffy hair, ran my brush through it and BAM! It was still straight! The last picture
is the one | snapped to send my sister! We couldn't believe it!! She ordered one right then and there!

So far I've used it three times and each time has been perfect!

52,"This is my first ""real"" flat iron (I've only had a mini flat iron before) and | have to say that it's a great product! I've tried a ghd, which IS a hundred times better than this, but also
WAY more expensive. For the money, | think this is the best of the best.

First, I'll start out with the things I loved about this product. | like that it has a quilted texture, making it easier to grip when styling. The swivel cord is also quite useful. | like that
you can easily adjust the temperature. It heats up pretty fast, and has a nice indicator light that tells you when the iron has gotten to your desired temperature. As for the actual
styling, it does a good job, but not amazing. | naturally have quite straight, thin-ish hair (it just gets sort of wavy near the ends) so it straightens very easily on me (but only on
the highest heat setting; | do use heat protectant}. However, when my mom (who has thicker, coarser, and more unruly hair than | do) tried it, it didn't do basically anything to
make her hair straighter, and it was on the highest temp. Another thing | don't like are the size and quality of the plates. They don't really seem like real or high-quality ceramic,
and are on the shortish side. And speaking of quality, overall it isn't top notch in terms of outward appearance. It looks even worse than a $20 flat iron; it has some small
scratches and scuffs and the plastic it's made of doesn't seem like the best quality.

53,"| purchased this a year ago based on the very high number of reviews combined with high ratings. | wasn't impressed from the start, but thought to give it a chance since so
many others were extremely satisfied with it, | do have rather thick and wavy hair, but not overly so. The things I'm disappointed with are that the temperature control is difficult
to see and maneuver. The temperature doesn't seem to get hot enough. It doesn't feel particularly smooth passing over my hair. It doesn’t have an automatic shut-off. So | made
do. but now I'm looking to purchase something else. I'm glad so many others were happy with the choice, but | will have to look for another brand.

55,"“This was a 5 star review from my first week*: This straightener works well, a little less heat then my previous one, but at least it doesnt pull out myhair! Was nice that the seller
included a bottle of oil for my hair.

“UPDATE™*

So, | had a lonika before I purchased this one. | owned it for 3 years! So, it was time to get another. (Note: I straighten my hair EVERY DAY, at night with a Remington Wet -
Straight and then in the morning with a ceramic to get the fly away's... so it it's used) I read my reviews, was going to go for the same but as | am a religious Amazon-er | figured
| couldn't go wrong with this so | ordered...

It was great the fist week, then | noticed my hair getting stuck in the sides where the plates attach.

56,"Ihave not had any relaxers or anything in my hair for years, so | have come to love my natural look and curls. However, this past summer, | wanted to try a new look so | decided
to straighten my hair, It's been a few years since | put any heat to my hair, so it was important for me to find the right product. That is when | found the HSI Professional Glider
on Amazon. The reviews were great and after doing some research, | finally decided to purchase the HSI. My flat iron arrived pretty quickly. It also came with the Aragon oil, a
glove and a cute little travel bag.

Overall, | am very satisfied with my purchase. You can adjust the temperature on the HSI and it did a good job in straightening my hair, The first time | used it, | was amazed on
how full and healthy my hair looked, Although it wasn't bone straight, | loved how natural, full and thick my hair looked. It also had some bounce to it. The second time | used it,
| don't know if my hair was getting adjusted to it (or if | had the Midas touch that day), but it came out so straight. My hair doesn't usually hold hairstyles too long, but | was able
to rock it a few days. Although | don''t like putting heat to my hair too often, when | do now, | definitely use my new HSI flat iron.

57,"Ihave owned 3 of these... The first two was purchased through HSI... They had the digital reading, after the first yr it would cool down to nothing while using... HSI had GREAT
customer service & had me send it back (no charge to me) & sent a new one as soon as they had confirmation it was sent... The replace they sent done the samething after 2 yrs..
| should state | don't use them but once a week IF THAT... | will say while they are working they are great... Let's not forget the price here... That's great as well.. The one |
purchased from Amazon has done great so far. Although this one does NOT have digital temp settings, whatever... Since | don't use a lot or often the HSI with its great CS will
do just fine for me.. So if your looking for something cheaper but good or for vacation use, then buy this one.. If your looking into LONG TERM & USING A LOT then move on. |

professional brands and THIS IS THE ONLY ONE that gives me professional results, | don't need to pass it many times or put it on a high temperature for it to work wonderfully
for me. Actually my first one of this, my very curly hair friend tried it and fett in love and she kept it.

59,"| originally bought this straightener back in November as a Christmas gift for my daughter. | accidentally knocked it off of the bathroom counter onto the floor last week and it
broke. | obviously had to buy a new one as not only was the drop my fault, but my daughter absolutely LOVES this straightener. Best she's ever used she says. She has very long,
thick hair (I have shorter hair, and not as thick--this straightener worked great on my hair as well). The plates are very nice on this straightener. | have owned two Chi's and |
would say not only is this flat iron just as good, | think it's even better. And | paid alot more for my Chis!

60,"had no reason to get a new straightener as my old one still worked, but it was a 2"" thick one, and | have cut my hair short (shoulder length) and | found it was a little too wide
for my new hair cut, so | wanted to get a 1"" as well. This had great reviews so | went for it!

Just to let you know where | am coming from... my old one is a cheap $25 one that | bought at Walmart and have been using for about 5 years. This is definitely an upgrade
from that. | don’t know that | have seen any improvement in my hair from using it, as some reviews claimed.

61,"Full disclosure, | haven't purchased a new hair straightener for the better half of a decade so take that into account with my review. I've been using my old one for years because
it still works.

| saw this come out on a really good sale and it had glowing reviews so | figured I'd try it out. WOW. The world of difference between this one and my old one is just mind
boggling.

| love that an oil treatment, heat resistant glove, and a storage bag are included with the straightener. The glove is an absolute game changer and | wish | had bought one years
ago! | am also blown away at how fast this straightens my hair which means less damage as I have to pass it over my hair shaft fewer times than my previous straightener. This
tackles my thick hair in less than 10 minutes, My hair is slightly longer than shoulder length currently and in comparison, my old straightener would take about 15 minutes and |
had to pass it over the same pieces of hair at least 2 or 3 times to get them straight. With the HSI straightener, it only takes 1 pass and occasionally 2 if | have a stubborn piece.
| am also so excited that this curls beautifully. My old straightener had wide paddles so | have to use a curling iron to curl my hair which meant that | basically had to heat
process my hair twice with the straightener and then the curling iron. This one creates very nice loose curls that work beautifully with my length of hair. Very impressed!

62,"ve had this straightener for a little over 2 years now, still just as good as day 1. Loveee it. Great quality too since I've dropped it (hard) more times than you can even imagine. If

63,"I needed to replace my old flat iron and decided on buying this one after reading many positive reviews about it on various blogs and I'm so glad that | did! I'm very satisfied
with the results. | have thick slightly wavy hair and always struggled with frizz but my hair is always super soft and sleek straight with no frizz whenever | use this flat iron. |
received many compliments from my co-workers about my hair when | first started straightening my hair with this.

I think the biggest selling point for this product is the tourmaline infused ceramic plates which is better at preventing heat damage as many claim...'m not sure if this claim is
really true but I have noticed a significant difference in that my hair doesn't seem to look damaged after using this flat iron compared to the ones I've used previously.

64,"Naturally curly to soft straight for 5 yrs and counting! This is such a great straightener that I had to buy it back to back. The first one lasted about 5 years, i definitely had to get
it again! After 2 more years with the new one, my hair is not damaged AT ALL and it has not killed my curls, My hair it’s naturally curly and when | straightened it with other
products it would fluff up after a couple of hours. With HSI it actually STAYS straight! | absolutely love it!

65,"I bought this iron back in 2016, and its 2022 now...the flat iron still going strong. I'm getting 2nd one now because my mom decide to keep it for herself, and she in Florida so |
will never get it back.

I've forgotten and left it on, and never had an issue. | think it turned off on its own... rarely leave a review unless its a BAD product. This Iron may not be fancy as other tools,
but I think its amazing to last this long and get the job done.

66,"I've used flatirons for a while. This was my first purchase from this brand. I'm keeping it as a back-up but it will not be my everyday styler. The spring on the irons is very strong
and | had to really squeeze to get it to hold tight to my hair (and | have long hair, so it’s very uncomfortable after a few minutes!) it also doesn’t seem to be efficient or as
effective as my old one, which I was replacing because it wasn’t as efficient anymore! It took three or more passes to truly flatten my long wavy (not curly) hair. In all, it will work
in my gym bag or desk drawer for styling emergencies. But | would not recommend it as your daily iron unless your hair can be flattened with lower heat and less sustained
pressure than I need.

67,"This is my first review on Amazon, because | really like this flat iron and want to express my opinion on it. It also comes with a free nice pouch and glove. | have tried a few drug-
store bought brands, but they always end up burning my hair. | have frizzy Asian hair especially after washing my hair, so i'm always on the lookout for a great flat iron, and at
the same time i'm not willing to pay more than $100. I've looked at other more expensive irons on Amazon, but end up choosing this one because of its value and reviews.
Although this particular iron does not have reviews for some reason, the other one with slightly different product (with bio silk sample) | believe sold by the same seller has
many great reviews. | wanted to try it on my own to test it out, and the end result is... | got silky smooth hair! | also tried to curl my hair with it, for the first time, so i did struggle
alittle with it, but once you get it, it gives you the curls that you want. | also used a heat guard to protect my hair as well before i use any iron or blow dryer. | also recommend
wearing a glove while using it since it can get extremely hot.

68,"This was my holy grail hair straightener. NOTHING straightened my 3c hair as easily and flawlessly as this tool. I've bought it twice for myself and have purchased it as a gift for
my best friend and sister. | have LOVED this tool.

But things have changed.
I have one straightener at home and one for the gym. I recently bought another just for travel so | wasn't constantly having to pack and unpack my hair tools, This newest

version purchased in September 2022 is NOT the same. The tool doesn't get as hot and, more annoyingly, the plates don’t connect tightly, meaning there's not as much tension
on my hair. Unfortunately, | took for granted that the flat iron would work as well as it always has and was left with frizzy hair at a conference.

69,"| would not recommend this flat iron for anyone who has a very tight curl pattern. | noticed that the iron does not flatten the ends of my hair well. The ends still stay fuzzy even
on the highest setting. You would be better off putting a little bit more money into a better flat iron. I think it was a waste of my money.

73,"I have thick, wavy hair and struggle with straighteners not getting hot enough. This straightener has been great- the adjustable temperature and lightweight design make this a
great product. Additionally, the quality is better compared to name brand high-end straighteners I've owned. | travel a lot and end up shoving it in my overstuffed backpack
where it is prone to a lot of shock and potential cord damage. This straightener has held up despite the ridiculous amount of wear and tear I've put it through. I can't say the
same for many other straighteners. This product is definitely worth the value and its performance is similar to much more expensive products.
