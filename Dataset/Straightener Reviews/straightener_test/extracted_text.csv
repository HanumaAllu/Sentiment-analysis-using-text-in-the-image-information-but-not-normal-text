0,"Recently my CHI hair straightener decided to sort of ""break"" on me. The last time | tried to use it | noticed that it was barely heating up when I set it on its highest setting. I've
had it for a few years so it wasn't too surprising that it was about time for a new one.

I spent maybe $80-$90 on my last CHI, so | expected to spend that much on another one. | looked for a CHI but the ones | found were too expensive for my tastes... upwards of
$100. | was about to fold when | found this HSI straightener.

The price was totally right and the reviews seemed spot on. | was really hesitant because you get what you pay for right? But I figured since it was so cheap I'd give it a go, better
than spending $100 or more | didn't really want to spend on a hair straightener.

The HSI came super fast (thank you 1-day shipping Amazon!) and | opened it up. Came with a nice silky case, a glove... thing, some solution for hair, instructions etc etc. | could
care less about the glove and hair solution, and | would for the case too but | think I'll actually use it to keep dust and whatever else from getting on the straightener when I'm
not using it.

1,"After | left the original review below, I was contacted by HS! Customer Service and was offered a free replacement flat iron, even though I had already returned mine to amazon.
How many companies these days do that?! | was very impressed and appreciated their generosity. | was excited to give this iron another chance, especially for free! | must have
gotten a defective one in the first place, because this one worked great!! It kept it's heat the entire time, I had it at 390. My hair is very smooth and soft, | can't stop running my
hands through it! | am very impressed. | think many of the one star reviews would be changed if they gave it another shot. | ordered the regular dial model, but was sent the
digital model in exchange, and | love it. | also curled my hair with it, and it worked great! Gorgeous waves, and faster than my curling iron. Unfortunately they didn't last any
longer than they usually do, but | think that’s my hair's fautt. | am happy to say I love HSI customer service and this product! Thanks!

2,"The product arrived on time and was very nicely packaged. It came in anice box with the straightener, a glove, a sample packet of argon oil, a nice, pretty travel bag and product
information. The bag isn't or at least didnt appear to be able to put a hot iron in it, seems it's just for travel with the iron cooled. I've been straightening my hair for a couple of
years now. | had a keratin complex straightener that | absolutely loved but unfortunately it stopped heating so I decided to try this one due to so many reviews. This is a good
basic straightener but it does not have a digital display and the box says it only goes up to 400° but the product shows it goes to 450° and | usually use my iron at 410°- 420°
but I'm not sure what degree this product actually goes to due to it not having a digital display. I felt the iron cooler after a couple of passes on my hair then had to reheat back
up. It did take a couple of passes to straighten my hair. The plates were a bit shorter than what I'm use to making it a little longer to straighten my hair but it did do the job as it
should..just took a little bit longer. | have very course, frizzy, curly hair and was looking for something with almost one pass straightening. Unfortunately, | had to return this
product but all in all the straightener is a good basic straightener, I'm just needing something a little more advanced.

3,"So the first one | purchased my BFF ended up narrowing for the unforeseeable future. The

second one my sister borrowed and never returned and finally the third, | gave to my mother as she was so impressed with my sisters. Which all of them still have years later. So
here | am buying another one. | honestly doubt given this products history and dependability that I'll ever purchase a different brand or merchant. It’s one of the best items I've
purchased here on Amazon. So if you're skeptical dor’t be...it'll last a long time and never disappoint, regardless of what hair texture you have.

4,"I was looking for another hair straightener to replace on old that | had for many years. Really didn't want to pay hundreds of dollars on one. This one was a good price and in the
range | wanted to spend for a new straightener. Item came nicely packaged and easy to use. The dial is located on the inside of the straightener and only lists 2 settings with the
dial. When you read the book it suggests the temperature range you should set it to based on the type of your hair. I had to guess where to put the dial since it should have
more numbers listed to help you determine the range to set the temp at. A couple features | do like: there is a light on it and once it reached temp, the red light turns to green;
the cord has an attached velcro strap the tidy up the cord when not in use. Overall | am happy with this product and works perfect for anyone that needs a basic hair
straightener. When | am using this, | always make sure to put a heat safe spray in my hair before use. My hair always comes out nice and smooth. When the item is no in use, |
store it in the bag that is provided. Wish they would add a strap that you could put on the front to prevent the straightener from opening up.

5,"This is a good basic straightener wish the plates were a little larger. Packaging was good. Received a very small free argan oil pack. It does a good job straightening my naturally
wavy hair. Haven't tried to use it other than just basic straightening. | like to use my straightener for other styles so will see how it works with creating curls and waves. Good
quality for the price.

6,"| ordered this flat iron for my little sister who has really thick hair - and I'm not exaggerating when | say her hair is thick. Her hair is that in-between straight/wavy. Her old flat
iron took nearly 2 hours to ""straighten"" her hair, Really, it didn’t make much of a difference. After a few hours out in the southern weather her hair was back to a frizzy mess. So,
| decided to surprise her with a new one.| was really impressed by the quality of the straightener even before we used it. It's really well made and the argan oil that's included
smells incredible! (\ just ordered a full size bottle.) You also get a glove to protect your hand from the heat. (It was way too big for either of us, but we have really tiny hands.)
The plates on the iron are wide, but not too wide. It's the perfect width, in my opinion. It’s comfortable to hold. It's not too heavy, but it's not lightweight and cheap-feeling
either, And it has a swivel cord to prevent the cord from tangling.

just as well.

8,"| used to have a Lionesse ceramic straightener but | guess they stopped making them. I decided to give this one a try and | love it! Takes seconds to heat up and the light turns
green when it’s ready. My hair is actually staying straight and non frizzy.

9,"I rarely wear my own hair as | love the convenience of extensions. (actually getting them back tomorrow..lol) Needless to say my hair is currently natural, I have never used any
type of chemical relaxer on my hair. My hair is weird as it is this odd combination of soft and curly in some places and then it gets very course in one odd spot at the top of my
head. and along my crown it can tend to be a bit thinner... so | needed a flat iron where | could control the heat.. I've had irritating experiences with flat irons getting far too hot
and leaving an awful burny smell in my hair. Ugh... so annoying having afro american hair sometimes, dang | miss my low maintenance extensions...
",negative
10,"Works great you can easily temperature control the device and the overall quality is high. I wish I had seen that they had another model from the same brand that auto-turns
off. If | could do it again for 5 bucks more I would have purchased that over wondering whether or not | had remembered to turn off the iron.
",positive
11,"What can you say about a straightener it gets really hot heats up rather quickly does the job well but it's supposed to turn off automatically and this one does not so that's why |
did not give it five stars
",negative
12,"This flat iron works really well. The temperature control knob is hard to see and use. I really like the size and it does a good job on my fine long hair!

13,"Honestly no complaints at all. Used many brands before and this works great. Ty ty!

14,"| gifted this straightener to my mom and she didn’t really like it. She said her hair kept getting stuck on it and that it didn’t iron the way she wanted it to. She also mentioned it
was a bit heavy. However | liked it. It didn’t find it getting stuck on my hair and it ironed good. I did however find it a little heavy compared to my chi. Either way this
straightener is very good and does the job. | like how to comes with a little sleeve and a glove to style your hair, It is very affordable for the results. | would definitely

recommend if you're looking for an affordable straightener .

15,"I like this flat iron. It works well and it heats up quickly. | wish the dial was on the outside, so you could see it easily. | like the glove they provide.

16,"I've never had any luck using flat irons myself. My cousin (hair dresser) has used them several times on my hair with success as in my hair looked great. | gave up trying on my
own a long time ago but after a year of switching from blonde highlights on my naturally mousy dark brown hair to bleaching ALL my hair PLATINUM blonde my hair was
breaking and damaged so badly... worst condition in my life! | had to cut off so much | hated it. Finally had to stop bleaching & give my hair INTENSIVE CARE! With so many
different layers from the HORRIBLE breakage.. the short cut & style... it took LOTS of effort with the blow dryer to look “okay” and my hair needed LESS heat styling to recover,
so | wore it in a loose ponytail most of the time.

Decided to try this flat iron since it claimed not to be harsh on damaged hair & wanted an alternative to TONS of work blow drying or a ponytail. Honestly wasn’t expecting
much but desperate times... and it actually did everything it said it would! With a medium-ish temperature setting it really helped smooth my hair, help the layers blend without
the time & effort & amount of heat | had been needing with just a blow dryer!

It hasn't seemed to cause more damage although | don’t use it all the time... I still air dry & put in a loose ponytail as often as possible as my hair continues to recover. But this
flat iron is easy to use, actually helps style my hair so it looks better than “okay” now.... 'm even highlighting now... & my hair is finally not a total nightmare. After 8 months |
can see real progress. minimal breakage, last hair appointment | barely needed a trim! It’s finally growing.. 'm becoming less self conscious about my hair & am feeling good
about how it looks now most of the time! But it’s been a long haul & truly an awful experience & tons of effort & care & special products to get my hair back.. and I've been
beyond meticulous about EVERYTHING I've used on my hair for 8 months & | can now say it was worth all the effort and caution & research...

and this flat iron helped me heal my hair & look “okay” when that was the best I could ask for & it definitely didn’t hinder my hair repair with the “usual” damage heat styling
products cause. And | still use it and am just thankful that | took a chance buying it because it really helped me through a tough time... so it has to be a GREAT product!

17,"| got this flat iron 3 years ago and it's still going strong. | got this to replace an old iron where the ceramic coating started to flake off and as a result my hair was getting
damaged.

The HSI iron has stood the test of time. Now | have natural, unrelaxed,thin, 4c hair with medium porosity and low density, with that being said | don’t use my iron every day. | use
it once a month or so but my iron still looks brand new. The plates still provide a sleek, smooth, frizz free results. The one thing | wish was different was the temperature setting.
I wish there was a notch system so I can be confident in the temp setting. | also wish the on/off switch was in another spot because I'm always afraid of burning mysetf. |
understand why the heat dial and power switches are in this spot because it means | can hold the tool without accidentally switching the temp or turning it off.

| think a lot of negative comments are from people who don't know how to use a flat iron for their hair texture but I've always had a successful silk press with one or two passes.
I can create easy bumps, flips, curls, and waves with the flick of the wrist because the plates heat evenly as my hair glides right through. I have small hands but | find the size and

weight easy to work with.

I think this is a really great quality flat iron for an affordable price. If | could change one thing I'd make the temp display digital, but that's a $200 price difference.

19,"This is a great straightener for rough hair. My problem with the item is that | can’t tell what the heat settings are. | know it goes through a board range but can the arrow be a
real red arrow? Can the temps be listed? Would have sent it back, but | ran out of time.

20,"I have loved this iron since | got it, however it didn't make it three years which is a bummer. | will buy a another brand and spend more money in hopes it lasts longer.

21,"This is amazing for your hair, the only downside is it’s heavy on your hands. My hands hurt due to early signs of carpel tunnel & it's heavy on my hand/wrists after a while. It
took some getting use to.

22,"This was for personal use; the perfect size, cord heavy duty, ample heat settings. Exactly what | was looking for

23,"Ok so | am Hispanic our hair is thick and frizzy | struggled to find a straightener that won't leave my hair dry because | usually put it on high setting for heat but with this hair
straightener my hair was soft even with the high setting on | liked how my hair felt the only thing I couldn’t get my roots flat so you could see the bumps at the top of my hair
so that’s why I rated it a4 star the only product | added before straightening was the L'Oréal heat protection spray

24,"My new favorite toy. The HSI flat iron came packaged with a few sweet surprises. The seller packed in a sample of HSI Argan Oil, as well as bonus HSI Heat Resistant Glove that
retails on its own on Amazon for $10. | had actually planned on purchasing this later. So | was pleasantly surprised to see it in my box. The flat iron itself comes with a heat
resistant pouch for storage. The iron is amazing. AMAZING. I have had both a Chi and a GHD and this far exceeded the quality of both. This boasts floating plates that have yet
to snag my hair, and again, to my content, a longer swiveling 7 foot cord, The 1"" plates heat up from 140F to 410F and can be used to straighten, flip and curl your hair. The
plates contain both ceramic and tourmaline making this a major selling point for anyone who has curly, frizzy hair. (Tourmaline in the plates increases negative ions which
balance hair to drastically reduce static and frizz while ceramic disperses heat evenly for fast, safe styling sealing cuticles to lock in moisture and leave hair smooth and shiny.) It
offers flash heating, and once hot, the iron stays evenly heated until you turn it off. For me, this is a single pass iron, I had no need to go back and smooth over with a second
pass. All the reviews on Amazon were right, this a superior product to any of the brand irons on the market. | highly suggest this iron, definitely get it while it's on the big sale if
you can! | don't know how long it will be before it's back at the $300 price point. Even if you buy it then, it's worth every penny!
