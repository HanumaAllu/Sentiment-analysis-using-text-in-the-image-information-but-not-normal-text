and fighting these are your movies. I watched it with my teenage son. Went out of
the theater twice during the movie to get some popcorn and a go to the toilet. Did
it deliberatley during the fight scenes. Didnt feel like T missed anything. Wick
rolling down the stairs reminded me of Neymar. How dumb and boring was that.
Before that, he fell from a Sth floor to the street and got up without problem. Even
my son found that to be too much. The New York Russians appear to be in a
Catholic church. Baba Jaga they keep refering to is not the bogeyman. Its an old
woman, thats what baba means. Something like a witch. But whatever. The good
thing in the movie are some colorful protagonists. I cannot but think these people
giving 10 stars have a vested interest to do so.

John wick is a character that he fight for love justic and good john wick is note a hero ,
he is a human , but he was a man makes his enemies liked him this move should stay on

best 250 movie list.

Every single actor , actress , director , camera man , producing team and writers was
doing his best and the get right what they want.

I like that this is the last John Wick movie because The way that the movie end is
fabulous and makes me (as John Wick fan) feel good and pleased

I like to say thanks to keanu , director ,writer and the hole team about this action movie .

2,"John wick is a power house of action movie franchise, 1-3 were incredible for being an
advancement in cinematography and choreography and incredible stunt work, so when
they announced a fourth one, well, I was anticipating yet another awesome movie.

I was... Half wrong; while giving me the action I wanted they stretched it for 3 hours
with dead unimportant dialogue. 0 emotion.

Every time they built tension in a scene and they stretched it too long, making the
tension tiresome and boring, leaving me waiting for the action scenes to keep the plot
going.

In conclusion, for a fourth film that concludes a series, like the matrix, they should've let
it go at the 3rd film.

3,"Greetings from Lithuania.

""John Wick: Chapter 4"" (2023) played out the way one could expect from this franchise in
term of plausibility. It is unrealistic in every possible way, yet its made in a way that it
looks real. And this is the biggest strength of Chapter 4. You have to leave all plausibility
at the door before watching it. Because when the movie starts - you are in for one
unforgettable ride.

Not only Chapter 4 is the best from the 4 movies now, it also puts to shame all action
films I've seen in many years. Its incredible movie on purely moviemaking terms. Stunt
team, choreography of fights, chases and kinetic cinematography are all put in a way I
don't think I haven't seen in Hollywood action film yet. I won't spoil anything, but one
particular action set piece near the end left me with my jaw dropped - the way it was
filmed looked kinda like a video game but so amazing at the same time. Creators really
outdone themselves with this film. And action aside (and there is more then enough of
it), | loved how confidently this movie was directed.

Overall, ""John Wick: Chapter 4"" is the best action film I've seen in many years. Reminded
me of ""Raid 2"" but with bigger scale and way bigger budget. This one has to be seen on
big screen - this one incredible action film. And running time almost 3 hours didn't felt
dragay - its superbly paced. One of the very best films of the year so far.

4,"This is honestly the best John Wick film since Chapter 2. My grandpa and I saw it
last Friday and yo, it was a blast for both of us because both are love with these
action movies. You can try understand John Wick: Chapter 4 is somewhat different
such as Caine, the deuteragonist, he's send to kill John which is antagonistic and
deadly; but you latter corne sympathize with him due to his goal to save his
daughter from execution.

I personally respect him for giving Shimazu Koji a honorable death in battle,
although Koji's daughter Akira wants revenge for that. Meanwhile with all the
bounties and man-hunts, I'll say itâ€™s practically all Santino's fault for forfeiting
John's life due to his desire to join the High Table and over run New York with the
Camorra.

5,"John Wick chapter 4 is without a doubt, the greatest ever action movie of our lifetime.
The film, which runs at two a half hours, is relentless. 90% of this film is action, it barely
gives you any time to breathe before moving on to the next fight.

And the action sequences themselves, are with out a doubt the best I've ever seen.
Spanning multiple locations, we have insane gun fights, swordplay, hand to hand, car
chases; even archery and as we've come to expect from Chapter 3, some dog killing
sequences.

The story is actually pretty solid, with the only negative of the movie being the cheesey
one liners from every character; but actually, I don't even mind - we know this is
supposed to be fun and not take itself too seriously, and whilst Keanu himself in my
opinion delivers his lines with incredible averageness, it almost adds to the movie. The
sets themselves are also gorgeous, taking us from Japan to France, and not once are you
disappointed with the scenery.

If you're a fan of action sequences, strap yourself in for the most incredible experience
you'll ever have.

impeccable. The fight choreography is fantastic. Keanu continues to own the John Wick
rale. Donnie Yen bringing all his skills to the table. This sequel just ramps up everything
this franchise represents. A Clean, sleek, modern action flick. This film is a masterclass of
peak cinema. The set pieces are on another level. Insert more praise. This is the one.
Definitely recommend checking this out. The cinematography alone is worth a watch.

everything for the sake of being watched , you really came out for a wonderful
series The BOOGEYMAN as JOHN WICK.

Being. An ardent fan since the release of the first one , I've been cautious going
into each subsequent film. Waiting to be let down and end my love for the franchise
This movie did the exact opposite . Waaaay over the top action , infused with a lot
more humour and tongue-in-cheek sequence , this movie deliver . So much so , i

8,"There is no denying that John wick series will become an classical masterpiece in future...
If you've seen previous 3 films you then you should know what to expect.. Keanu Reeves
is back again legendery hitrnan aka Baba Yaga who'll stop at nothing to earn his freedom
and defeat high table and seeing him doing that will give you an unforgettable cinernatic
experience. For 3 hrs I was lost in this epic world that director Chad Stahlski has created
for this story, Keanu Reeves is already an action icon, rest of cast has also done a perfect
job.. Action choreographer and stunt team deserves an Oscar for their effort which lead
us to some of the best fight scenes and action sequences ever played on big screen.
Cinematography Is also very beautiful, dark and neon filled visulas just enhance the
experience of story there is also some drama and emotional moments in this story but
main aspect of this film is out of the world action.. There is a unique over the head
camera action scene which is best part of this movie, Donnie yen is also great here
proving again that he is one of the best action stars of Asian cinema, Scott Adkins is also
done a surprisingly great scene which I was not expecting because he usually play
hardcore fighter in his movies here he is hilarious and his look is different.. From start to
finish JW 4 is an action ride which gets better and better each passing minute, 3rd act
will keep you edge of your seat, last 45 to 50 minutes were some of the best action
sequences I've ever seen in my life and I've seen thousands of films from every genere
from all over the world cinema industries so i knaw a good action scene when I see it and
believe me this was something I've seen first time in my life.,.. Overall don't miss this
film if you're fan of action movies and if you're an Baba Yaga fan like me then just go for
it to experience it on big screen with Dolby atrnos sound you'll spend a quality time...

AN MODERN ACTION MASTERPIECE.. i0/10.

9,"It begins right at where chapter 3 ended, and John still trying to make the high table
understand he wants to be left alone. And within a couple of minutes happens the only
logical thing and bodies start piling up.

Without going into specifics you see stuff happen to the NYC Continental and the Bill
Skarsgard character recruiting, more like forcefully dragging one of John's old friends in
order to get the job done, and at the same time we're introduced to the Tracker character
that has a cute malinois with him because we know how much this franchise love dogs.

THE ACTION Set pieces are insanely paced and the movie never lift the foot off the gas
that even though the movie has almost 3 hours you won't feel it at all. The whole chase
in Paris has John dispatching henchmen with ease drifting around and dodging oncoming
traffic as the High Table price on his head increases pulling even more assassins. There's
an scene inside a house after that with an overhead shot that makes it look like a video
game and the whole theatre was laughing at how John moved around using walls for
cover and using dragon's breath shotgun shells (net a spoiler as it was in many trailers).

It's not every day that we see a franchise get better with each film, specially with a
sleeper hit in 2014 that was my favourite film of that year with reason. Watch this movie
in the biggest screen available and don't go for a large drink because even though it
doesn't feel like it's 3h long, otherwise you'll be very uncomfortable before the credits.

10,"John Wick Chapter 4 is lengthy. By lengthy I mean it has an action packed first act
followed a slower second act sans much action but makes up for it with the craziest final
act where all hell breaks loose. John Wick after surviving the fall in the previous film, gets
back to business of killing his way to freedom. The table has found a new head who pits
John's friend against him. As the brutal fight resume, John is suggested a clever way out
of this mess and how he pulls it off being an ex-communicado forms the story.

Donnie Yen's addition to the franchise takes the fourth film a notch higher, raising the bar
for the stunts. The first act is indeed action packed and it flies by quicker than the bullets
fired. The second act gets the story forward without much action until Scott Adkins shows
up, which makes for a stylish action block with enough humor. The highlight is however
the final act in Paris. The insane action sequence leading to the final fight gave me my
money's worth and also covers up the generic weak villain which Bill Skarsg&rd tries to
make merry off.

It is indeed a fitting entry to the franchise and the first John Wick film to have an end
credit scene, one has to sit through the end credits completely for that scene.

11,"I've enjoyed each John Wick movie more than the last. 4 > 3 > 2 > 1.

The ""Neon Noir"" style is so pretty and they continually bring artistry to the violence that
keeps it fresh. I wish I could be an extra during the underground party scenes because
they lock so cool.

Despite a long run time T didn't feel it as the pacing and build was very good. Stakes ,
pacing, timing , consequences !

The art and back rounds lend life to the seedy underworld
There was quite a few more new characters introduced in this one and they do a very

good job of fleshing them out and making you care about them or giving them their own
style.

12,"I saw John Wick: Chapter 4, starring Keanu Reeves-the Matrix movies,
Dracula_1992; Donnie Yen-the Ip Man movies, Shanghai Knights; Shamier
Anderson-Awake, Wynonna Earp_tv and Bill Skarsgard-the It movies, Atomic
Blonde.

I love the John Wick movies and they just keep getting better as they go along.
The action is off the charts, the stunts are better than ever, and just when you
think there is nothing new to see in a fight-or car chase-Baba Yaga will surprise and
shock you. Keanu returns for maybe his last ride as John Wick, at least according
to how this one wraps things up-but, I'm sure Keanu still has another one or two
left in the tank. Bill plays the Marquis, a sort of big shot in the High Table
organization that wants Keanu dead. Donnie plays an old friend of Keanu's that Bill
forces to hunt Keanu. Shamier is another hired gun that Bill gets to join in on the
hunt, Shamier is called the Tracker and has a highly trained dog that tag teams
Shamier in fights-on voice commands. All Keanu wants is to get his freedom back
and his name cleared. He learns of a loop hole in the High Table rules and focuses
all his abilities on reaching that agenda. One of the fight sequences on a flight of
stairs is very entertaining and the car chase in Paris is unbelievable-kudos to the
stunt people. Make sure you don't leave the theater too soon because there is a
scene after the end credits that involves a charactersâ€™ fate and there is a dedication
after that to Lance Reddick-he died March 17 2023-who played the hotel concierge,
Charon.

It's rated R for violence and language and has a running time of 2 hours & 49
minutes.

14,"Having watched all the prequels to this high octane action film .1 was excited for the
sequel to be released in the theatres shortly having gotten the opportunity to watch an
early screening of the film before its theatrical release I was hyped as I had read
somewhere that this time the bogeyman takes on the high table itself . And believe me I
was not disappointed though a bit slow paced at the beginning the moment John Wick
start on a killing spree the action sequences, gunfights are so good and satisfying that it
kept me to the edge of the seat and willing to cheer him for every enemy he takes down
Donnie yen, Scott Adkins, Hiroyuki Sanada were icing on the cake.

15,"John Wick Chapter 4 is a love letter to action film-making and every action cinema lovers
wet dream. The cinematography is oscar worthy, the neo-noir genre has never looked
better on the big screen as the bold and vibrant colours makes each scene of this film a
bold underlined statement that what you are experiencing is something special.

The action choreography utilizies 100% of each and every set design used in the film to
incorporate drama, thrill and also comedy. This movie has everything you could ever ask
for - guns, knifes, nunchucks, katanas, martial arts, cars, flamethrowers, bare hands etc.
The stuntwork is jaw-dropping and adrenaline inducing, specially a stunt that was
performed on a staircase on the later half of the film, left me wondering how did the
stunt coordinator get that Tom Cruise-level life threatening stunt greenlit.

But what truly makes this story special are the characters and the drama surrounding
them as they manoeuvre their way through this twisted world of crime where each
person is their only friend. There are a lot of new characters introduced and none of them
feel throwaway as each and everyone of them bring something new and exciting to the
table and moves the narrative forward. And the centre of this narrative, Keanu Reeves
who plays John Wick, a loving husband proves once again why his contribution to this
role will be remembered forever as something that revolutionalized action film-making.

This was the one of the most satisfying experience I ever had inside a movie theatre and
it leaves you with the question that how many times are you going to return to
experience this once in a lifetime masterclass in action film-making.

My personal best part that the production brought legends here Donnie Yen and Hiroyushi

Omg! How happy I was to see them here! We should see more of those talented actors!
The storyline is very good here!

Action, fights choreography, locations! Visually just beautiful too! Really well done! Keanu
also bravo! More fighting scenes instead of just shooting guns.

T usually write bad reviews, because unfortunately nowadays more garbage than good
quality movies, so this one definitely deserves praise! !!

We need more good films and less waste of money and time kind of movies!

17,"I truly loved this movie. So much bad a** action. The music was just so awesome too.
The fight scenes were just so cool, but I did think they lasted a little too long, and there
is no way someone is walking away from what John Wick went through in all of it. It did
run wayyyy too long on all of the fight scenes even tho they were great. I loved all the
actors. This is just one of those great action movies that just hit the spot for me. The dog
was a fun addition, and I assume that the person with the dog will show up again in
future movies. I highly recommend this movie if action is your thing. Great fun.

18,"It's definitely not the best of the 4. No question about that but it's alright. I read some of
the reviews around and I do agree with the plot holes that most have recognised. Most
notably the fight scenes in the night club.

Literally hundreds of people dancing while wick fodder get an axe into the head or
machete up the nose or whatever. I could write chapters on how the fight scenes are
nonsense if you really want to analyse it.... But If you've watched the first three and still
have feelings of incredulity then seriously what's wrong with you?

It's John Wick he shoots people in the face for 2 hours and says ""Yea!!!"" Yes it's
regurgitation of all the previous but what did you want? John Wick working at an animal
shelter and trying to save the planet.

It's not brilliant but if you are like me and are a fan of JW then you won't be
disappointed. You just go into that world for a couple of hours and you get what you paid
for.

Also I really should give it a 10 for the tribute to the warriors but he didn't fight the
baseball fury's Also I think they upgraded the tech that the girls use. I didn't see a
Commodore 64 None the less. It's a solid film and JW shoots a lot of people in the face. 1
hope there's a JWS.

19,"Is this watchable? Yes. Is it better than another bland Marvel movie? Yes. Its not a
bad film, its John Wick but longer. The problem for me is the bullet proof suits.
Everybody has them. People get shot point blank and just keep on about their
business. It makes the action boring to watch. Theres never any risk to being shat
at. How many times does John Wick just walk forward doing the same repetitive
moves with his jacket covering his face? Too many. The bit on the steps is boring
and we basically have to watch it twice. I'm all for a big action movie that looks
nice and has a big, diverse cast but the bullet proof suits just take away any sense
of drama. He just becomes a bullet sponge and it becomes boring. For all the
spectacle, some parts felt like watching somebody playing a video game. Also,
Hollywood needs to stop making Donnie Yen blind in movies.

than turns into a blazing orgy of violence through multiple dancefloors is a standout
sequence.

Shamier Anderson is excellent as Mr Nobody who's dog deserves an award for best
canine performance right now!

The scene at the end where a faceless female DJ with a sultry voice speaks over the
airwaves encouraging the bad guys to go after Wick whilst playing some groovy tunes

22,"Intensely engaging, immensely satisfying and courageously anguished, this John Wick
chapter delivers the goods and then some. It's a testament to the durable potency of a
well-executed, non-formulaic action film. There's so much raw vitality here, that one will
barely notice the running time.

Keanu Reeves never loses his power ar presence as the former hitman who once again
faces an imposing army of antagonists and pursuers even as he plots his own course of
payback, Although some action sequences can be a little protracted, in the end, they
achieve lasting and memorable power on account of this director's knack for innovative
camerawork.

This time around, John Wick's globetrotting work puts him in the crosshairs of the
Marquis Vincent de Gramont, a cold-blooded member of the High Table. Their rivalry
becomes a fierce battle that is waged at first in Osaka then Berlin and then throughout
the streets of Paris. It's an opulent, labyrinthine showdown that we don't get to see very
often in action films. Lush, colorful settings adorn the violence and bloodshed, almost as
if to have to the physical beauty bely the depravity and carnage taking place.

Recommended to everyone, regardless of their preference or penchant for the action
genre. Many modern action films are solely for action fans. This proves to be the
exception.

23,"John Wick: Chapter 4 is an overwhelming feast of action brilliance! For the entire 2.5-
hour runtime, this movie transitions fron weapon to weapon, set piece to set piece, and
spectacle to spectacle topping anything ever seen. The fight sequences never stop, and
their beauty and intricacies drop jaw while breaking jaw. From the scene with the
nunchucks to swords to shotguns to hatchets to hand-to-hand - among the greatest, if
not the pinnacle, of action choreography. The cinematography creatively showcases each
scene and battle, painting the action in bright colors and finding clever angles to keep the
action fresh and engaging. As always, Reeves Is incredible in the role, but the supporting
cast of martial artists helps make this film what it is with experienced actors like Hiroyuki
Sanada and Scott Adkins. But the absolute standout is Donnie Yen; his speed and skill
are breathtaking as he steals every scene he is in. Unfortunately, despite all of its
stunning brilliance, the story takes a lot of shortcuts to wrap up John Wick's story, which
disappoints a little. The method to end it all seems like something that would have been
mentioned several movies ago. But honestly, who cares? We don't go to a John Wick
movie for a deep story. We go for the martial arts and gun-fu, and John Wick: Chapter 4
delivers an unparalleled masterpiece of violence

24,"This movie has it all and then some. At no stage does it ever pretend to be anything
more than it is or was always going to be. In fact, it doubles down on its
preposterousness and unashamedly pushes out a high fueled octane nonsense film of
staggeringly little story.

The first hour has almost no storyline at all - why bother at this point - just extremely
well crafted fight scene after fight scene. Scenes of huge ornate mansions/buildings with
hundreds of faceless henchmen to slaughter. Righteous revenge. Blind ninja assassins.
Kevlar dinner suits. Fast and the furious level corny. Keanu has about 10 lines the whale
movie - but that's a benefit trust me.

Do you need to have seen the other 3? Maybe but not essential. Number 5 is a certainty
at this point - look for the spin off as well. If you want to check your brain with a
franchise this is the movie for you.
