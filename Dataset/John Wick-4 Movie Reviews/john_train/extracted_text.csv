0,"John wick chapter 4 is the best of the John wick series, and that was very hard to do
after the first three. From start to finish it is a pure adrenaline rush.

The acting is top notch - Keanu reeves it top quality as always - Winston and the Bowery
king are acted amazingly - but the two new character who stole the show were Donnie
Yen as Caine and Mr Nobody - really awesome characters - hope to see mare of them in
the future.

For me - this is the best action film of all time
The choreography - the set pieces - the insanely violent action and the camera work is all
done to perfection. Genuinely brilliant from start to finish, Chad Stahelski is also top

quality and has defiantly come to his own as a director.

I cannot recommend this movie enough - I cannot find a flaw in the 2h 49m run time
(which only feels like 2h). Do yourself a favour and see it in cinema.

1,"John wick is a power house of action movie franchise, 1-3 were incredible for being an
advancement in cinematography and choreography and incredible stunt work, so when
they announced a fourth one, well, I was anticipating yet another awesome movie.

I was... Half wrong; while giving me the action I wanted they stretched it for 3 hours
with dead unimportant dialogue. 0 emotion.

Every time they built tension in a scene and they stretched it too long, making the
tension tiresome and boring, leaving me waiting for the action scenes to keep the plot
going.

In conclusion, for a fourth film that concludes a series, like the matrix, they should've let
it go at the 3rd film.

2,"Greetings from Lithuania.

""John Wick: Chapter 4"" (2023) played out the way one could expect from this franchise in
term of plausibility. It is unrealistic in every possible way, yet its made in a way that it
looks real. And this is the biggest strength of Chapter 4. You have to leave all plausibility
at the door before watching it. Because when the movie starts - you are in for one
unforgettable ride.

Not only Chapter 4 is the best from the 4 movies now, it also puts to shame all action
films I've seen in many years. Its incredible movie on purely moviemaking terms. Stunt
team, choreography of fights, chases and kinetic cinematography are all put in a way I
don't think I haven't seen in Hollywood action film yet. I won't spoil anything, but one
particular action set piece near the end left me with my jaw dropped - the way it was
filmed looked kinda like a video game but so amazing at the same time. Creators really
outdone themselves with this film. And action aside (and there is more then enough of
it), | loved how confidently this movie was directed.

Overall, ""John Wick: Chapter 4"" is the best action film I've seen in many years. Reminded
me of ""Raid 2"" but with bigger scale and way bigger budget. This one has to be seen on
big screen - this one incredible action film. And running time almost 3 hours didn't felt
dragay - its superbly paced. One of the very best films of the year so far.

3,"If you want to watch fighting for 3H, beyond a rational setting, this is the movie to do it.
I was well-produced, but it was almost exclusively fighting and shooting, mayhem for a
long time, no police

There was really not complexity to the story. I would give the story a 3 or 4, really, just
nothing really there. However, because the action was good and I like Kineau Reeves, I
gave it a 7/10.

Tan McShane is always fantastic, and Bill Skarsgard was a good arrogant villain. IP Man,
Donnie Yen, was fine. The fight scenes were so long you could go to the bathroom and
come back and it would still be going on, not missing much but more fighting.

I am not surprised about the high viewer ratings, but I am surprised by the high critics
rating, because simply not a lot of story.

4,"This movie is amazing on all levels.

Best time spend in the cinema in a long long time.
So many perfect shots. Loved it big time.

If you like action adrenalin movies, you will love this.

I watched all the John Wick movies 3 times, and this will definitely get a rewatch when it
comes out on blueray. This is a must have.

Great Cast, Great acting, Great koreografi, Great kamera angles, Great action, awesome
music. Loved the tempo og the movie.

As an old dude (36), i'm very impressed with all the work Keanu Reeves puts his body
through. I felt beat up in my own body, so many times during this movie. Keanu Reeves,
just like Tom Cruise are some of the few, last real action Heroes <3.

5,"This fil is unmatched, unparalleled and out-skills any action film ever made in the
history of cinema...it Is in a category of its own. Keanu Reeves is a martial arts badass
menace. John Wick Chapter 4 needs no introduction and there are literally NO WORDS to
describe the masterpiece that I have just witnessed in the cinema. Which is the only way
to see this and do it justice. Part 1 was insane and Chapter 2 was crazy amazing, but I
actually skipped Chapter 3 as Halle was very boring in the first hour. However I knew
with Bill Skarsgaard as the villain, the Swedish actor known for IT, that this should not be
missed as dude can act. Well Lo and behold nothing prepared me for the fight scenes, the
BODY COUNT, the 99 lives of John. Donnie Yen is amazing end of story. Keanu is
everything. And the cinematography and the locations in Europe are breath-taking. ..like I
watched the most beautiful dream. Lord Jesus Christ the Berlin club scene, The fight
sequence on Paris's Arc de Triomphe, speechless. Let's just say that Chad Stahleski gave
us violence with a capital V in its most artistic form. He's the Michaelangelo of cinema.
Deepness, love, fear and fatigue. Remember the insane fight scene on motorbikes in
2017's The Villainess, a messy Korean revenge masterpiece? Well ALL of John Wicks fight
scenes are this but on steroids. Respect and Rest in Peace Lance Reddick.

6,"Unrealistic ridiculous fight scenes with Kevlar suits have ruined the last two installments
of what could have been a great film series. The elongated fight scenes have been hard
to bear. The staircase sequence was the icing on the cake for over the top hilarious
overdone nonsense. Everyone and anyone sitting in the movie theater was shouting
""c'mon"" on almost every overdone scene. If they had just stuck to a more believable
approach this movie would have been an hour shorter and a lot more bearable to say the
least. I left the movie ready wondering why the director(s) didn't see the flaws in the 3rd
installment with the cartoonist fight scenes and go back to the drawing board. Definitely

reminded me of a Michael Bay film smh.

7,"After watching this at the cinemas in America with my Mum and Dad here's my spoiler-
free review of John Wick: Chapter 4! As usual, I'll be talking about my thoughts, what I
enjoyed most about this film and my conclusion/rating! Keanu Reeves returns as John
Wick & he's fun to watch, Donnie Yen as Caine is Bad A since watching his fight scenes in
Rogue One as Chirrut Imwe and now this, Ian McShane as Winston is awesome and even
pays tribute to the late great Lance Reddick who sadly passed away from Ischemic heart
disease! My favourite part of watching this movie was the action scenes they're so well
done & very well choreographed! Overall I enjoyed this more than Shazam! Fury of the
Gods that's why I'm giving this an 8/10! There is a post-credit scene at the very end so
don't go anywhere until that's finished! ;-)

8,"I really don't understand how this movie garnered such a high score. I felt like I
was in a Star Wars sequel with people either running or being shot at for almost 3
hours. Cinematography was fabulous and it did take you to other countries in a
realistic and enjoyable way, however, so if you could sit back and enjoy that, it was
worth it

I believe Keanu Reeves’ immortality outperformed Mel Gibson in the Lethal Weapon
series after being shot about 84 times, thrown down flights of stairs multiple times
and off buildings - and no - the Kevlar suit wasn’t convincing to me.

Whereas blind people can do amazing things, Reeves’ love-hate relationship with a
former friend was not convincing.

In college, I learned that fiction still works if it is at least somewhat believable in its
own setting. This one missed the mark.

9,"Well thats what john wick movies are. If you find it fun to watch a lot of shooting
and fighting these are your movies. I watched it with my teenage son. Went out of
the theater twice during the movie to get some popcorn and a go to the toilet. Did
it deliberatley during the fight scenes. Didnt feel like T missed anything. Wick
rolling down the stairs reminded me of Neymar. How dumb and boring was that.
Before that, he fell from a Sth floor to the street and got up without problem. Even
my son found that to be too much. The New York Russians appear to be in a
Catholic church. Baba Jaga they keep refering to is not the bogeyman. Its an old
woman, thats what baba means. Something like a witch. But whatever. The good
thing in the movie are some colorful protagonists. I cannot but think these people
giving 10 stars have a vested interest to do so.

10,"These mnovies have always outdone themselves, but here we are with an actual “epic”.
John Wick: Chapter 4 continuously punches above its weight with bigger and better ...
well, everything. The lighting is better, the staging is more impressive, the fight
choreography is absolutely insane. The excess here is the point, and it's never been more
satisfying. The entire Osaka sequence feels like a marathon; then he's gun-battling in a
speeding Barracuda; and there's even a setpiece built around stairs. The man even fights
a guy in traffic.

TRAFFIC!

1 freely admit that I'm that guy in the theater that squealed when the nunchucks came
out (and they weren't a one-and-done either, he just kept beating people!)

This gave me the ""Top Gun: Maverick"" kind of high; an impeccably-paced three hours of
sustained adrenaline. I don't think such enjoyment of bone-crunching violence is normal,
but I don't care. This movie was an absolute blast!

11,"Although this latest installment was a tad bit longer than the rest of these movies in the
series it was every bit worth it. With the introduction of a few martial arts Legends the
movie took the series to the next level.

The creative Geniuses behind some of those long single shot fight sequences deserves a
hats off. A couple of them really stand out. One overhead shot of John Wick running from
room to room fighting his enemies And the other with John Wick, Donny Chen and group
fighting in a room filled with art pieces made of bulletproof glass.

The climax was one to behold as well.
On the whole it was a fun John Wick experience with a lot of entertaining fight sequences

that makes it worth your money and time. And if you are a John Wick fan, this was what
you were waiting for, and it's not going to disappoint you

12,"John Wick: Chapter 4 is one of the most exciting,hyperkinetic and beautiful action movies
ever made. Director Chad Stahelski has make a name because of this franchase. Chad
has crazy,modern ideas. We see how Keanu was saying about 300 words but on the right
spot. Baba Yaga is fighting versus High Table and we see Marquis who is Bill Skarsgard.
Wow!!! He actually was the right actor for this role. I was shocked by Akira she deserved
series or movie. Winston again with crucial role In this movie. This movie is D category or
16+ and this have a lot of blood and fights. This movie is perfect deserve to watch!!!

13,"Directed by Chad Stahelski, John Wick Chapter 4 continues the struggle of John Wick
(Keanu Reeves) with the price on his head ever increasing, he finally uncovers a way to
get free of The High Table for good. But he must face off against a new enemy with
powerful alliances across the globe.

Since this franchise started in 2014 with the release of its first movie, I'm in awe of how
this franchise has come. I had no clue what they gonna bring in the final chapter since
the last three movies always set the bar higher for the next, especially the action
sequences. And somehow they still did it and 1 think it's a perfect culmination and the
best movie probably not just in the franchise but also in modern action movies ever. The
amount of story and action is quite perfectly balanced, it's kinda an improvement from
Chapter 3 which I think is just endless action from the beginning. They also introduced a
lot of exciting and interesting new characters each with enough backstory to understand
their relationship with each other and their connection to the story

Donnie Yen, Bill Skarsg&rd, and Scott Adkins are simply phenomenal. Scott Adkins is
almost unrecognizable in prosthetics and a fat body suit and we definitely need to see
more of Bill Skarsg§rd playing this type of role, he nailed it, The technical aspects are
jaw-dropping, spanning from camerawork, stunning visuals and colors, and gorgeous
cinematography to production and sound design. Some movies, especially action flicks
definitely have one if not more memorable sequences, well John Wick: Chapter 4 is
packed with over-the-top and memorable action sequences, the stunt choreography is
truly flawless.

Salute to director Chad Stahelski for delivering the John Wick movies that were distinct
from the others and closing them perfectly, he really saved the best for the last one (or
there might be more). I'm excited to see where this franchise is gonna be taken next.

Don't let the length fool you, you won't feel it as soon as you hop in for an exhilarating

14,"I, just like many others, went in with high expectations because of the anticipation of this
movie, and amazingly enough, did not disappoint as well as exceeded my expectations!

As a newcomer to the John Wick franchise, but having been aware of it for a very long
time, I really love these films, particularly the first one. After watching Parabellum, and
slightly wondering if the caliber and scope of it can be overtaken, I was gladly mistaken
after seeing this film. The IMAX experience was breathtaking and impactful, so if given
the opportunity, definitely don't miss out. But, watching it in a regular cinema is also
equally good. While I don't want to spoil, J find that the movie felt way shorter than it's
2h 49m runtime, as 1 felt that Parabellum felt around 20 minutes too long. So if runtime
worries you, I can assure you that it is not a problem, but a positive.

The movie left me highly satisfied and breathless, so massive props and respect to
everyone involved in superseding the other entries and reinvigorating the action genre. It
really feels like a once in a lifetime example of a genuinely impactful action movie. Please
watch it and I feel that a 10 is worthy simply because of enjoyable nature, which the
movie leans into. It does everything an incredible movie needs, and easily makes it one
of the best movies as of late, and the apex of this amazing franchise! Also props to Keanu
Reeves for inhabiting this character as well, as nobody brings it like him.

15,"First of all, I went into this 4th installment of John Wick with little expectations. I was
thinking that 3 movies were perfect to end on. The perfect trilogy, why ruin it with even
more installments? And I generally thought they would somehow mess up this movie?. I
am now deeply ashamed that I thought that way, because this turned out to be much,
much better than what I expected, hell even better than the previous installments (in my
honest opinion).

This was the 2nd John Wick movie I saw at the cinema and once again, it was an
amazing experience. The action was constant. It was relentless, it was bloody and it was
just even mare constant. I felt like it would never let up. I freaking loved every second of
it. They really went fully into town with this, especially with that star studded cast
starring Donnie Yen, Yuri Boyka himself (Scott Adkins) and of course some familiar faces
from the previous installments. This was by far my favorite John Wick installment.

were also very good. Keanu Reeves was perfect for this rale. Yeeahh :) Some scenes in
the movie bothered me. Especially the scenes of not bleeding and cops scenes, but still, 1
think it was very good. It was fun to watch in the cinema, Same scenese were funnish. It
wasn't necessary. Also, the shooting scenes were very good. At the same time, the disco
scene, the scene shot from above, looked very epic. I was blown away by these scenes.
The ending of the movie was a bit simplistic so the ending was disappointing.

17,"This is honestly the best John Wick film since Chapter 2. My grandpa and I saw it
last Friday and yo, it was a blast for both of us because both are love with these
action movies. You can try understand John Wick: Chapter 4 is somewhat different
such as Caine, the deuteragonist, he's send to kill John which is antagonistic and
deadly; but you latter corne sympathize with him due to his goal to save his
daughter from execution.

I personally respect him for giving Shimazu Koji a honorable death in battle,
although Koji's daughter Akira wants revenge for that. Meanwhile with all the
bounties and man-hunts, I'll say it’s practically all Santino's fault for forfeiting
John's life due to his desire to join the High Table and over run New York with the
Camorra.

This film delivers action at its purest state. The Berlin sequence it's just perfect , the

The biblical references and John's resolution are well stated. Do not try to analyze this
movie as something that is not trying to be.

Remember what this franchise is all about, revenge, action, weapon skills, martial arts

20,"As a cinephile and decades of watching action movies, one is not as tantalized by the
mere act of killing and car chases. What Wick 4 attempts to do is bring the action to
another level on top of the prior 3. Not an easy task given the relentless killing and video
game level of endurance the main character has. It is akin to the experience of watching
Fast and Furious. We know no one could survive the falls and gun fights, and that is part
of the fun. The audience is in on the joke sort of speaking. Dialogue is used sparingly.
The mystery of the High Table, the almost religious codex that is followed by the criminal
organization gives the movies a greater meaning than perhaps the sum of its parts.
Reeves is a perfect fit, and we cheer for him as he appears to be the best most
conscientious of the worst the org has.

choreographed fight scenes that transcends what you would deem possible in a movie!
Outstanding use of marcial arts and many of the scenes are insanely well shot with
incredible long takes that will stick with you! Some out of this world set pieces!
Soundtrack was amazing as well and gives you just the vibe you need!

Caine was by far my favorite addition to the movie! He steals every scene!

The story line does not exist, just shooting. It starts off with John shooting some random
Arabs and an important black character just gets randomly killed off.

The bullets have no impact on John. Falling off a 5-story building has no impact on him
either. Just gets up. But the movie is not called ""Superman.""

The dialogue was written by a 12 year old.
It tries to be funny by having a dog bite the testicles off one of the bad guys and then
pee on that dead bad guy. Seems to have worked because almost the entire theater

burst into laughter.

that's plenty of dough but with each iteration the movies become ever more flabby and
contrived. The Hollywood formula has been employed; copy a previous success adding
ever more crash bang and wollop and of course stretching the whole thing out to a dreary
3 hour run time. But of course Hollywood misses the point, yet again. What made the
original Wick movie interesting was the character's struggle to make a new life only to be
dragged back into the criminal underworld. Granted it's an interesting and novel criminal
underworld but now it's the world of John Wick which is the focus, not Wick himself. Time
to call it a day.

24,"Let's be honest if, by now, you choose to see a “John Wick"" movie then you know what's
coming. Several hours of hyperkinetic, over the top violence with a pounding soundtrack
and moody lighting. On this front ""John Wick: Chapter 4"" delivers and then some.

There isn't a plot that I can recall but once again our favourite assassin is wrestling with
the unseen High Table and the price on his head is increasing faster than post-Covid
inflation. So every goon in a suit is out to collect and John has to wade through a tsunami
of bodies in order to, well, keep killing people.

Clearly there's no logic here as John has no identifiable motive anymore or even an end-
goal in mind. Instead he's the main character in a video game and you're watching a
Twitch stream of someone talented playing all the way through to the final boss.

At one point this characteristic is cemented, in spectacular fashion, when the camera
shifts to a top-down view and you get to watch John move from room to room in a bloody
spree. It's a fantastic sequence, right down to the spray of blood as henchmen #89 gets
shot in the head at close range.

So Is it a great film? Well yes because ""John Wick: Chapter 4"" plays it straight down the
line and sticks religiously to its aesthetic. There are no in-jokes here, in fact there are
more grunts than dialog, and the film absolutely believes in itself. On that front it's a
right belter.

Just sleep less time some days. Even 5 minutes less a day can get you your wasted hours

whole franchise since they are able to criticize it, then the movie is a masterpiece... And
Chapter 4 is a masterpiece... Enjoy if you are an action fan, you deserve this + + +

26,"The Wick films now have something in cormmon with another popular franchise; the
Road Runner cartoons. Wick is now more invulnerable than Wolverine. Last movie
they dropped him off of a building. In this one they do the same but why stop
there; they drop him off two buildings with nary a scratch. Wick just gets up and
keeps on killing. Who cares right? Certainly not reviewers and critics who are giving
this cartoonish movie high praise. But why stop there? Let's let him get hit by no
less than 4 moving cars that would have shattered bones in a mere mortal. But
let's go for more. Let's drop him not once but twice down hundreds of stairs only
for him to get up and kill dozens more. My wife ( having loved the first 3) was
thoroughly disgusted with this movie and I was quite dismayed myself. Wick
peaked in the second brilliant one but they turned this into a stupid Fast and
Furious movie defying what punishment a body can take. Wick is not hurt once
except in the final gun battle. The movie gets a few stars for the cinematography,
stunts and the great first big action action scene in Japan with the equally great
Hiroyoki Sanada. Sadly the movie goes downhill from there. Watch for cartoon fun

one of John Wick's new superpowers, to be able to survive long falls. The Scout
character is extra stupid and unnecessary. I don't understand his motivation.
There's too many characters here that are supposed to be important. I just found
everything confusing and redundant. There may have been one or two scenes that
I liked but J can't even think which they are. Keannu is too slow now to pull these
fight scenes off. Donnie reprises his role from Star Wars Rogue One. I just think it's
a messy movie.

did not know so many of the spoilers since 1 followed the online info pretty closely. Over

hours and 35 mins of fighting while the remaining 10 or so minutes was acting.

The usual far too long fighting scenes where he does his usual MMA moves by getting the
enemies head between his legs while he reloads his gun and shoots him the head.

For me it was at least an hour too long and could have been much shorter, The storyline
was very weak and after such a long gap between this and John Wick 3 I am surprised it
was written better.

topping your last go- not in the case of the John Wick team. They keep figuring out ways
to keep the story interesting, delivering on the action set pieces and adding to the lore in
a very effective and stylish way. John Wick 4 was an absolute pleasure to watch. It was
full of entertainment. Despite being almost 3 hours long, it does not have boring
sections. The non-action scenes have interesting characters, drama and incredible
production design. John Wick continues to raise its own bar. As in the previous entries,
each action set piece is distinguished and powerful. This Is one of those movies that must

a few creative aspects to the fight scenes, cinematography and effects, but in terms of
the writing the whole movie was just one long incessant fight scene repeated what felt
like hundreds of times without any story to break it up or make any of it matter at all to
the viewer. In action movies it's obviously about the action and not much is needed to
make the story ‘matter’ but my goodness at least have the basics of an actual story that
makes the action compelling in some basic way. There were a number of excellent actors
in this movie but sadly the writing made it so that even they couldn't contribute anything
to the story. Went in excited but I seriously wanted to walk out about half way through

when I realized it was just going to be non-stop fight scenes and nothing else for 3 whole
hours. It was truly mind-numbing

main character John Wick. This is the best film of 2023, already. There I said it. It's
already the best film of 2023. John Wick's Chapter 4 1s one of the best action films
this decade. I enjoy this film, no; I loved this film. I loved this film, My dad and I
watched John Wick's Chapter 1 on opening day, and now we watched it on opening
day; and Chapter 4 didn't disappoint us at all; we had the best time with this film.
Bill Skarsgard, Donnie Yen, and Scott Adkins were brilliant in this film, and they
didn't disappoint us in this film as it's such a good plot during this film. The story is
well done as it shows and expands the new assassin world. And the action, I can
keep going on and on about the action and I am so anticipated that I want to see
the movie again, of how good the action is especially the overhead scene that was
inspired by Hotline Miami. That scene alone made this film a masterpiece. I could
watch it over and over again and I will never get tire of watching it. The story is
really good and the ending was a huge plot twist, as we though there were going to
make Chapter 5. And in all honesty if they end the story here with John Wick, that
would be okay, because, I seriously don't know how on god's earth will they top
this film. And If they ever do a Chapter 5, Please bring everybody back that did
Chapter 1-4 for Chapter 5. My dad and J are huge fans and we will continue be
fans, we love the film and for my dad it's already the best film of 2023 in his eyes.
Cinematography, soundtrack, visuals are ALL astounding. There is only a nitpick
and that is John Wick still is clean after all the fighting. Overall, John Wick's
Chapter 4 is a true masterpiece of action filmmaking, It's a film that manages to
exceed the high bar set by its predecessors, delivering a thrilling and emotionally
engaging experience that leaves you wanting even more. If you're a fan of action
movies or just great filmmaking in general, then John Wick Chapter 4 is an
absolute must-see film. I give it a 10/10 rating without reservation. I am wanting
this film to get this film a billion dollars at the box office, Because it deserves the
money, and time to see on the BIG screen. I am going ta see this film over and
over again. It's a masterpiece. 10/10.

4th movie in a cinematic universe be the best yet. It's non stop action from start to
finish. Keanu is one of the greatest action stars to ever live. I really hope they make
more. The fight choreography is second to none, the gun play better than ever, and the
casting is stupendous. The plot is top notch, the Wickverse is better than the Marvel
Universe and any film universe. He deserves all the plaudits for what he has done with

this character. You need to see this movie multiple times. Best film I have seen at the

new heights with even more intense fight scenes and a thrilling storyline that keeps you

any spoilers, I can confidently say that John Wick 4 exceeds all expectations and is a
must-see for fans of the series and action movie lovers alike

it's the best John wick and all of the characters that are added do an amazing job beat

37,"From the very beginning to the end, nothing but endless kills, fighting, close combats,
bloods squirts or splashes, KR after four chapters, he looked older, slower and tiresome.
The screenplay was so pretentious and pointless, the dialog looked forced and boring,
katana swords vs. Bullets, and almost every bullet could be fenced off by the katana
sword blades. The scenarios and the plots just kept stacked up without any reason or
clue, just kill, kill, kill...nothing but kills. All the fighting sequences just like Shaw
Brothers’ 1970s poor and laughable Hong Kong martial art movies, heavily
choreographically staged, looked so forced and fake. Every kill was not killed with one
bullets but many, yet the handguns seemed equipped with endless bullets, bang, bang,
bang, even the fallen guys already dead, but still needed to be shot several times more
to increase the violent sound effect. I don’t know what's the purpose of making these 4th
Chapter, and I think the ist Chapter only needed a following 2nd Chapter to end it, but
what the heck, brainless young viewers need bloody fights, more dead bodies, ridiculous
screenplay with clueless storyline, no real plots or real story really needed, just created
something like violent video games.

When John Wick fought for his life in the Japanese hotel against so many clueless foes
and the Zatoishi-like blind swordsman played by Donny Yen with a Botox injected face,
we all decided to quit at the same time.

38,"For nearly 10 years we have been treated to the joy that are the John Wick movies. The
nicest guy in hallywood has been able to reinvent himself into one of the baddest hitmen
ever to be played on screen! The 4th installment is no exception

Ive seen a lot of reviews and reports surrounding this movie and the state that John Wick
had found himself in the last 2 installments. Wick 2 i would say hes fighting at 30% hp
and Parabellum around 1hp and still managing to slay very time. This time round hes
back to full health and ready to take on everyone who stands in his way.

With the sudden passing of Lance Reddick im sure they had multiple stories for his
character as it sounded very much from the press tour that his character was going to be
round for a while after this mavie. Nonetheless he went out in the way that his character
has always been, dignified.

Less just say one thing that the villain of any movie deserves credit for making a movie
just as epic as it can be and Bill Skarsg4rd is no exception here. Typical man at the top
that gets everyone else to do his dirty work. Clancy browns Harbinger is awesome and a
great addition to the mystery that surrounds the world of the hitman for hire.

I cannot fault this film yet again, action movies for years to come will be looking back on
this to create an epic fight scene half as well as the smallest of scenes in this film. Just
one more thing to say that a fight scene between 2 factions of Ninjas is just as epic as
ever before.

Fast forward to this installment where the stakes are higher for John Wick. There are a
lot of twists and turns in this one, along with some of the best fight choreography in
movies. The longer running time didn't really seem like much since the pacing of this film
is fast and exciting.

One note: Lance Reddick's final onscreen performance was sentimental to watch. It's
hard not to think about what happen recently with his passing while promoting this
movie. Other supporting characters make it woke up until the very end but Reddick will
be missed.

finest. No one goes to see a ""John Wick’ movie for anything remotely close to realistic
fights or gun battles- it's about the body count, hand to hand combat and just how far
the director will take things as John absorbs so much abuse yet hardly comes away with
a scratch!

Tusually avoid movies like this however will admit it took my mind off the daily crap of
life. This one is much better than the last one- Halle Berry's character was more annoyin
to me than a female killing machine complement to Keanu Reeves' character.

There are scenes in Paris, New York and Berlin - topnotch cinematography that surpasse:
the other films. And the fight scenes are well scripted- kudos to the work Reaves and the
stunt people put in to make them outrageously entertaining!

storyline right out the window type of movie.

Action junkies...this ones for YOU!

At any rate, this was absolutely horrible writing. For the last 3 Wicks, every decision just
brought him back to square one. Its an endless loop. A writers nightmare when you dont
have a story that progresses.

Where this really shines is the cinematography, and fight choreography. Stunning work by
the everyone on the crew. Pretty amazing the type shots they were able to get in and
had some really good one shots. The fights scenes are awesome but just kinda got old
when the movie is nearly 3 hours long.

50,"The stunt-work is amazing, let's start with that.

Editing is quite nice. So is photography. Acting is not much needed in the movie. At least,
acting is not needed as much as stunts. I mean, the action scenes are - how can I put
this delicately - impossible or borderline fantasy level unless the whole film is in The
Matrix, and also the third film, of course.

The character development does not exist, physics does not defy John Wick ever. The
opposite cannot be said, though.

Even if you turn off your brain and watch, most of it does not make sense, at all.
However, if you are into mindless, illogical action scenes, John Wick is the film for you
One more thing, in a gun fight, if you lose to a guy who cannot see, in brightly lit
environments, maybe you should give up your career as an assassin. If not, you deserve

to get killed in ""action"". One intriguing character was Mr. Nobody, unfortunately, though,
the writers bestowed upon him the part of Martha (Batrnan vs Superman) in this movie.

scenes I have ever seen. They push the limit, the intensity, the absolute insanity how can

3 hours and I'll be happy. Then you've come to the right place in Hollywood. Hollywood is
for the mob what was once the arena in ancient Rome, but the light version, The rabble,
ignorant, feasting on big screens where violence is shown as necessary, tough and sexy.
John Wick is like American porn: do you like chocolate? Then we'll drown you in it. The
film has a total lack of drama, a total lack of imagination and, even worse, a total lack of
humour, After the umpteenth headshot I look bored at my lukewarm popcom. Kenau
Reeves, the Internet's darling of good deeds, plays a depressed killer in a black suit who
does nothing but kill people. A feast to watch for the poor in spirit. Hollywood: we've got

53,"This is a tough one. Not only to review, but also to watch. Never before have I seen a
movie where the opponents are so obviously taking turns attacking. There are countless
scenes in this movie where John Wick is fighting multiple opponents and every one
except the one he is currently fighting is dancing around awkwardly in the background
until its their turn to attack. It's infuriating. And it happens constantly throughout the
movie

Now, not everything about the action is bad. Some of the fight scenes are awesome,
mostly the ones where he is fighting someone one on one.

The camera work, scenery, set design are all beautiful. Even the story of this installment
is better than what we had previously. The movie also introduces a couple of fantastic
new characters and the conclusion is quite satisfying.

All that to be completely underminded by the truly atrocious fight choreographies
throughout the movie. They made this an absolute chore to watch at times.

54,"The story was ok but could have been better flushed out. Fight scenes are great
but they were way too long and so unrealistic. Not nearly as good as the other 3
movies. If they would have given us a little more background on some of the new
characters it would have made more sense and given them more depth. In
previous movies John would use his Krav Magra skills to take down or slow down
someone then a double tap to the head would usually be sufficient. Those fight
scenes were outstanding and believable. Almost all of fights in this movie
ridiculous. People were shot and stabbed several times and looked like they weren't
hurt. How many times did John get hit by a car and just walked away? How many
times do you have to hit someone in the face with nunchucks before they go down
Tused to think John was special. The Baba Yaga. But in this version he is made to
look almost invincible. Really, did they have to get so far away from reality this
time. 1 left somewhat disappointed. Was I watching a movie or a video game?

John wick series has always been over the top action thriller focusing on getting the

trying to tell the most compelling stories about Stylish assassins.

John Wick chapter 4 does justice to the characters and leaves room for future possibilities
to branch out from the universe of John Wick. The movie keeps you engaged from the
start with Loveable dogs, Guns and a man in black suit who wants to kill everyone. Plus
he actually runs out of bullets and reloads the gun in between fight scenes.

It's astonishing how story is so driven to tell you and remind you again and again that

otherworldly lighting. The cinematography is insanely good and a treat for the
eyes. Choosing the action set pieces to take place in Osaka to Berlin to Paris gives
the feeling that you as the spectator are being taken on a journey, thereby
justifying the almost 3 hour run time, Donnie Yen's character; Cain and The Tracker

what I thought to be roughly 15 thousand souls, I started to feel like I was missing out
on life, The feeling grew exponentially, with every batch of 5 thousand casualties.

When John Wick began his ascent to the top of Sacré Coeur, where he faced a hundred
new villains (probably the planet's last surviving human male specimens), I considered
leaving, But it was Mr. Nobody yelling his ""balls"" cormmand (whereupon his dog jumps at
a man's crotch, and then urinates over his dead body) that achieved the feat.

On my way home, I reminisced about the good old days, when an action-loaded, far-
fetched but highly entertaining movie could be squeezed into 87 minutes (e.g.
Commande, 1985; btw. 51% of the running time of John Wick: Chapter 4).

franchise was strong enough to merit at least 3 sequels. Jury still out there. And, most
important, you have to believe that the key to making a good film from an essentially
weak and over-done premise is to extend it to 3 grueling hours, and throw lots of money
at it. Donnie Yen steals every scene he is in, and makes you wonder if his semi-
retirement from Asian films was really a good idea? And the writers have stolen tropes
and tricks from a handful of prior productions including KUNG FU (wise sayings); MY

66,"Still one of the best action films of the best action film franchise, but I can only give this
one a 9/10 when the first three films all got 10/10's. The main reason is that for this one
being the longest of them all, the plot had more holes and the random new characters
lacked the background they needed.

Throwing in Mr. Nobody was just dumb, as was his story. It was just too random and lazy
especially with all that extra runtime. Having all the opportunities to collect the bounty
was just too easy and took away from all other more deserving assassins to collect, and
more importantly, his reasons for not cashing in were just too ridiculous. Instead of
introducing him as a new character, they should've capitalized more on Fishburne's
character and involved him more in this film, instead of him being a delivery boy, that
was just a huge let-down

And as much as I ove all the action scenes, and they were the best and longest thus far,
they just didn't feel as authentic as the action in all the precious films. Nevertheless, still
an amazing film, it's the writing that could've been better.

67,"John Wick Chapter 4 is everything you'd want from this tremendously popular franchise. I
would describe it as pure ""choreographed aggression,” like a delicate ballet. But instead
of Swan Lake, this is all about bullets and knives. Incidentally, don't trouble yourself with
a body count. The sheer number and intensity of ""kills"" will truly elude you.

JW4 rather nicely returns for a riot of startling violence tempered by a melange of
perfectly cerebral philosophical moments. Unlike the sardonic ""ultra violence"" of Stanley
Kubrick's, A Clockwork Orange (1971), JW4 is sensibly raw, with just enough creepy
humor to keep you from completely jumping out of your own skin

It doesn't hurt that JW4 has a great cast. Reeves immediately sells Wick & company's
dark commitment with a raw emotion somewhat reminiscent of a Clint Eastwood
Western. The massive emotional exhaustion which unfolds simply adds more gravity to
this newest Chapter. ""Sauce for the goose,"" one might say.

Flaws? Very few. And JW fans won't care. This is what makes cinema so FUN, especially
now that we're all feeling some relief in this post-pandemic world. JW4 is heavy, exciting,

oscar. If you are going to see this movie your attention will fully in the movie and won't
be distracted at all, the action scenes are the best and Suprisingly there is more comedy
than i expected and the dialogues form each character is great. There are obviously some
problems with few parts of the movie but it doesn't affect much to the movie, problems
such as few scenes where it was looking obvious it was cgi but the cinematography made
up for it ,and Secondly it felt like Wicks pistol had unlimited bullets and it did make it feel
a little unrealistic and lastly the end credit disappointed a little bit, we expected the end
credit would be something unexpected and mind-blowing but it did kinda disappoint.

But overall with these problems it still didn't matter as the movie was on another level its
the best chapter out of 1 2 3 and it was worth the wait of 4 years . And might be one of
the best action movie. This movie was loved by the audience in the theatre they enjoyed
every part of the movie the reaction were great The hype about this movie was worth it
and you would want to watch it multiple times.

70,"I can think of no other series of movies that consistently improves upon itself than the
John Wick series. This fourth installment improves even upon the fantastic third movie.
The action sequences are unparalleled and the martial arts sequences are, as always,
phenomenal. I agree with my fellow reviewers that this is definitely one of the greatest
action movies ever made - as were they all. It is clear that the Director and Production
Team really put a lot of effort into pushing the boundaries of action, and the location of
Paris was used to maximum effect to produce some stunning action sequences. Make the
effort to view this movie at the cinema, as you will get the full cinematic experience that
this film needs to show all of the work put into it.

71,"Clocking in at a bladder-busting three hours, this fourth Johnny Wick movie from
Lionsgate stubbornly sticks to the franchise's formula. The vague plot sees John Wick still
on the run from the High Table, who have not only raised his bounty to $20 million, but
also deconsecrates and destroys any Continental Hotel linked to John's movements, Cue
a number of repetative action setpieces (all happening at night) that are separated by
static dialogue scenes in which characters spout non-stop aphorisms, the first one being
no less than Ned Kelly's ""Such is life.""

Delayed two years by the novel coronavirus pandemic, JOHN WICK 4 has Hong Kong
martial arts cinema legend Donnie Yen co-starring as Zatoichi-style blind swordsman
Caine, an old friend of Wick's. The supporting cast is filled out by Bill Skarsg&rd, Ian
McShane, Clancy Brown, Laurence Fishburne, and Shamier Anderson among others.
Major disappointments are Keanu Reeve's worst ever line readings, and the wimpy melee
fight scenes: punch, kick, chop, stab, pointblank CGI headshot, repeat. But such fare saw
JOHN WICK 3 earn $328 million from a budget of $75 million, so loyal fans should enjoy
it. I reckon it's good for one viewing because of the ending. There's also a scene in the
credits. 6/10 Weet-Bix.

72,"John Wick is not only a movie, it's a emotion that uncovers a path to defeating The High
Table. But prior he can ear his freedom, Wick must face off against all the odds and a
new enemy with powerful alliances across the globe, With base story the movie prceeds
as John Wick, a professional hitman and assassin who has gained legendary reputation
for his set of skills and is now hunted by the High Table

John returns to NYC and meets with Winston who himself seeking revenge against the
High Table - suggests that John challenge de Gramont to a duel, as winning will free him
of his obligation to the High Table. As per the Table’s traditions, John can only request a
duel on behalf of a crime family; seeing as he previously severed his ties to the Ruska
Roma, John travels to their headquarters in Berlin to receive a new crest marking his
membership to the syndicate.

73,"I'm gonna have to rewatch this one another day. But I found myself beginning to doze off
repeatedly like an hour 1/2 into the movie. I can't quite put my finger on it. The villain
was definitely boring, the story line and dialogues seemed a bit stretched out. The fight
scenes and overall feel of them didn't quite do it for me like the first 3 movies did. I think
there's gonna be mixed reviews on this one. I felt there were several plot holes. And I'm
in limbo about how I fee! about the ending. It seemed fitting but then also didn't...? Lol.
Idk man I just think some lazy writing went into play on this one.
",negative
74,"My expectations were high specially around the fight sequence but it was disappointing.
Last three chapters had some special sachets | set ups and sequences, the stable fight
scene and the knife fight in the antique store. That was the genius of the movie, even
though you expect it to be a kill fest there was creativity around that preventing it from
being repetitive.

Chapter 4 is just that, pretty much the overdose of the boring sequences from the first 3
chapters.

The other aspect around how much hits and badgering can John take is also puts this in
superhero genre. I mean, he is not captain america for crying out loud.

The storyline holds well though there are crucial pieces missing. How did he find the elder
and was it just to get back the ring? With almost 3 hours duration you expect to cover
that. There are lose ends with a daughter's revenge for her father and John wick letting
his friend die in vein

I feel they could've cut one fight scene to cover these points and competed the movie.
This series had done so well to bring continuity all this time just to drop the ball at the
end!

average acting, and fight scenes that are so poorly done you don't mind going to the
bathroom. Don't get me wrong. I loved John Wick 1. Thought #2 was OK. Then came
#3., It showed they were out of Imagination and should have stopped with #2. Now with
#4 they show that they are not artists or creatives but merely clowns looking for as buck.

It's not completely without value, which Is why it got a 2 instead of a 1. The photography

is beautiful and they have a dog as a hero. The rest is worthless, Save the money and
the time.

101,"Seriously, guys?... All that hype... For this!... I don't know why everyone is praising this
movie.., Maybe because it's the first "" masculine "" movie in a while... I'm with you on
that... Can't even remember the last male lead movie out there Imao... But seriously, it's
the worst out of the John Wick movies...long story short... It's a filler movie... Total
lacklustre... The movie is unbelievably empty and predictable...most of the scenes are
literally identical... maybe because there's literally nothing happening other than fighting!
... No story or events .,.. The movie is only somewhat watchable because the cast is
awesome and charismatic! ...some of these guys are like 60 but they're killing it...
Anyway... Another let down....so, let's see... operation fortune.. Wack... Bullet train...
Waaack... the John Wick finale...Sadly... also wack... Let's hope Mission impossible is
gonna be different....and if you want a nice action flick to watch... I recommend wrath of

where I found myself wanting for the fighting to end because it felt repetitive.

The bad guy was one of those ""T'll sit around and so nothing but look sophisticated and
rich until I get killed” typed of bad guys.

The blind guy had super hearing while fighting everyone else in the movie except when it
came to fighting John; then he was just a regular blind guy who couldn't hear if someone
was death or alive.

The ""nobody"" character could've been out of the movie and nothing in the movie
would've changed.

loved the 1st JW movie, liked n°2 & 3 but this one, OMG! Just because the movie is filled
with action scene doesn't make it a great movie. Honestly it's wayyyyyy too long, the
rythm is bad, the John Wick character and arc are uninteresting as hell, other characters
are under-developed, too many CGI, and OMG the ending just sucks a** There are
some good fight scene in the movie, that can't be denied, but there are also way too
many non-sense as well (e.g. The scene in the Berlin club where people keep dancing lik
nothing is happening while bullets fly and axes are being burried in heads right and
there, come on...). Don't know if this review will be helpful, be just be aware of the false
hype. JW4 is not a good movie, sorry.

repetitive almost slapstick comedy actions like Laurel and Hardy . There is just too much
overacting in this movie... The steps fall scene near the end is just silly. There are some
very flat scenes like the card game scenes, So the movie was overrated, didn't blow my

mind and definitely I won't be watching this again ever.....1 am glad I didn't pay to watch
it.

105,"If you enjoy watching over-egged, relentless fight scenes with no real story then this is
the film for you and your 2 brain cells. Easy to follow, limited dialogue and the bullets
don't seem to kill anyone. Amazing how many times John Wick can fall down 220 plus
steps and effortlessly get up and go again. Furthermore, the genius idea of a blind
assassin might not be to everyone's taste but it's amazing what you can do these days
with a walking stick. Bonus - you can get away with a sleep in the middle and still keep
up. The actual storyline (if you can call it that) could have been wrapped up in 5 minutes,
but I guess they had a film to make so needed to stretch it out - and boy, did they?!

106,"This is by far the worst of the 4 John Vick movies. It doesn't explain much to the viewers
about what is going on and why. As in the other Vick movies the hero kills and kills, in
many scenes they have so many killers coming at him and shooting that it would seem to
be impossible for him not to get shot. He does wear Kevlar suits but Kevlar suits do not
cover his whole body and Kevlar generally will not stop bullets from long barreled
weapons such as assault rifles which are in use throughout the movie. In a 'shoot 'em up!
movie like this the viewer has to suspend belief and just enjoy the action but the
writer(s) and director took too many liberties, the movie isn't believable - even with
suspended belief. At 2 hrs and 45 minutes, this movie is way too long, to fill that time
they included long scenes of killing bad guys and it gets very repetitive and tedious. You
should skip this movie, it's not worth 2 hr and 45 minutes of your life.

together in short time (even if it is over 2 hours), I bet that even the most fanatic

Wick shooting people for 2hours and 49 minutes. He never gets hurt, he falls from 30
meters and doesn't break one finger, pretty sure he shoots around five hundred people
and he doesn't get one single scratch. There is no story line, it is just shooting and non
sense. I dont understand how so many people like this movie, its one of the worst movies
I've ever watched. I'm glad this sequel is over so I never need to waste 3 hours of my life

watching John Wick's non sense. Very disappointed, they could have ended so much
better!

find a value in this movie's plot. Well, I didn't watch the prequels. So, perhaps I may be
missing the true core value of this flick. Who knows ...

First, the plot summary: People are getting killed over and over and over again. That's it.
End of story. Period.

Yet, for what cause do they fight? So, they just hate each other?? ... or love each other?
Hundreds of ther? And they all just die in seconds? where did all these fighters get their
training from? How did they all master such training if they all die on a fast lane in the
end?

110,"Thaven't written a review on IMDB in a while, but after watching JW4 last night I wanted
to get my thoughts out there, although they are seemingly against the majority of fans
and reviewers out there.

My thoughts on the series as a whole are that #1 was something special. It made me and
many of its fans feel something when we watched it. It had emotional impact and weight,
that really was the core of the movie. Sure the action was innovative and fantastic, and
Keanu was awesome, but it was all meaningful and heavy.

Number #2 did a lot of things wrong that started the downfall of the series. The lore of
the continental assassins universe was just botched plain and simple, and it lead to
horrible writing decisions. Instead of John taking on a mission of his own will like the
first, a new rule is invented as a plot devise to ""make"" him do something, which was
pointless anyway because he then tries to kill the guy who is making him do all this
anyway. Then instead of being an amazing assassin and figuring out how to kill the guy,
he just breaks the main rule and gets everyone rightfully against him because he broke
the one rule. It also introduced the stupid invincible suits that was the first step into
fantacy and ciinernawers
",positive
111,"Is this a game, or is this a movie? 90% of the movie is bad, exaggerated fighting. How
many times can one be beaten before they stay down? An enormous number. How far
does one roll down the stairs after being hit? Infinitely far... Thin plot, poor acting. Why
did Keanu agree to this? Here, you get the feeling of watching a game, not a movie. Is
the blind man blind, or can he see? One has to make up their mind and stick to the
decision. Someone here has done a poor job with their homework. Let's hope this was
the last movie, because we truly cannot bear the thought of there suddenly being a
plausible reason to make another one
",negative
112,"After the pleasant success John Wick was, the creators somehow managed to made their

magnum opus John Wick 2, the best one by far, where the whole idea of the unstoppable
legendary assassin gets fully realized.

In this movie, however, just like in the last one they tried making the action more
bombastic by giving the villain “all the power in the world"", not only overcomplicating the
whole lore of the assasins guilt (once again) but also turning the whole action of the
movie into a cartoonish mess.

Once again the Baba Yaga gets turned into a damage sponge who keeps just walking off
been thrown off high buildings, getting run over, punched and hit with multiple objects
and still winning every fight by the power of deus ex machina.

113,"So I did not watch 1-3 of this installment, and was anxious I would not understand
what's going on. So I watched the recaps on youtube and entered the cinema somewhat
prepared, At least lore-wise. After 10mins in to the movie I suspected that the ""lore"" was
just a bleak background for the sparse dialogues happening. After 20 min it became clear
that this movie has no serious connection to anything worthwhile. Not even its own lore.
The dog? No where to be seen. The car? Dunno. Dont want to spoil but there is nothing
to spoil. Cut out the constant beating and shooting out of the movie and you get maybe
15 mins of lore. Its so boring, I cant understand the hype around John Wick. I just waited
180mins for him to finally finish

I guess Keanu Reeves stopped acting and turned to gymnastics

table is simply ridiculous... who chose the head of the clan.... well, it's not at all...
Marquis Vincent? It doesn't play at all .... it would be better if they did a comedy .. The
only phrase was something like “I am a Note"") Keanu is a pity, they made it some kind
of Looser in the film .., constantly snatches .... constantly substituted .... and they don’t
take bullets ... and an endless magazine of cartridges .... and a sword fight against guns
at the very beginning is generally trash .... spoiled the film with endless slaughter .... the
first and second films were a top but the 4th is like a game where you need to wet
evervone ... about nothing at all ...

certian amout of suspention of dissbelief when it comes to most movies but this one is off
the charts. When I seen 8.3 stars on IMDB I was excited to go see it. I almost walked out
and I can never remember doing that before. Little to no real plot. Just shooting and
fighting to the point of boredom and I loved the first one. I like a good action movie but
come on. I would not go to see John Wick 5 which I am sure will be out there Just like
Fast and Furious 57 or whatever number thier up to.

It appears there is no real thought anymore in Hollywood. Wayyy too mant sequals with
no original ideas for new movies. I guess thats why I rarely go to the movies anymore

116,"While John Wick 4 points with extraordinary beautiful cinematography and some well-
made action sequences, it fails apart at two key points when it comes to movies for me.

Firstly the plot. What is this even about? Who knows. People care for the action. But why
do we then need to watch more than one hour of build-up for the action, you could watch
the action without understanding what is going on, you don't need to know why these
people fight, there is no conflict, and even if there is, it doesn't matter, because it has no
consequences to the plot. The problem is that the plot is only sequenced trough talking,
ne visual language.

That makes the movie feel like a video-game, The action-scenes are the one you
interactively play, and the talking scenes are just long cut scenes. This Formula works for
many games, but you can skip those cut-scenes. If it's a good game, the gameplay will
make your blood rush and you will not care for that dialogue pause. Best example is
Hitman, you don't care for the story, you just want to play.

quality are quite on the lower end.of.the spectrum and doesn't really stand out.

The movie didnt contain any storyline that will.captovate one, its fairly predictable from
the start, there are a few exceptions throughout the film were one would be intrigued,

but the movie itself seems to be a low budget movie with very low quality stunts.

I wouldn't recommend the movie, even the cinema was fairly small, since not many are
attending to watch

but it was filled just with fightin scenes that were absudly long and exagerated more than
in a superhero movie ( batman, superman ). Characters were like if they were written by
a 10 year old and werent interesting at all, scenes were made Ok and cinematography
was on point, storyline was the worst, movies was so long so slow and you would know
how it ended before even a scene began. I dont know how this movies got this high

tempted. I think if you are 13 years and this might be action-porn for you. The first John
wick was solid, this was not.

There is scene where something happens to John and that was funny. I don't think it was
supposed to be funny. But I was too frustrated with whole film. There is scene which

What was wrong with this film

Plot: the plot, like in most action films, is paper thin. Like most other reviewers
have stated, you forget why he's doing what he's doing. This film had NOTHING to
do with the first three, which is part of the reason of the success of the franchise.
Nothing from the 3rd film was answered in this 4th rendition. What happend with
Winston and Keanu from JW3? Why was nothing talked about, It's almost like
writers retconned that whole scenario and it detracted from the movie. In the
beginning of the film, JW kills the guy who heads the table. Kinda pointless, this
should've been the climax of the film

The guy must have killed a hundred people in the story, almost all of them with one
quick snap shot with a handgun, while all of them were shooting at him, sometimes
with submachine guns, but never managed to hit him!

great in them,as well he was great in the movie, but ALL opponents and people around
Keanu were so badly coreographed, not only once but sooo many times the opponents
were just ""waiting around” until Keanu turned around and expedited them. I know this is
make-believe but some semblance to reality would have been appreciated. What bad guy
in real life does not attack the hero from the back until he turns around, thats when they
move. All the other Wick movies surpass this one. The action int eh first and especially

the second movie were soo good. These high ratings the movie is getting is unfathomable

No creativity, mundane action scenes, not impressed with even one. Instead of
complaining about this movie, please someone tell me of any redeeming qualities. I
was really disappointed in this sequel and again I'm a big fan of John Wick. The

absolutely nothing aside from getting all of his friends killed in his efforts to get

the way that the characters kept claiming that you can't change your nature, and
how nothing meaningful changed in the end, I can only conclude that the
pointlessness was the point.

Should we try to better ourselves? No, says this movie. Should we try to better the
world? No, you can't do that claims this movie.

People, this movie claims, are nothing more than idiotic sheep that will just keep
doing what they are doing, even as people are being brutally murdered right before

again.

I went with my buddies to this movie. Afterward we all thought this movie was horrible.
One thought it was a comedy, because of the way the killings happen. I felt the assassins
trying to kill Wick could have been soccer moms with no fighting experience, it was that

off at how they could miss shooting a guy standing next to him. I dozed off for about 10

Bullet train and other movies produced from the same production. Just another typical
villains and typical fight scenes over and over. This John Wick production team or
""franchise"" has transitioned into a new Fast and Furious franchise making the same
movies again and again by replacing cars and gimmicks. If they pivot and make some
tums to adapt new ingredients that we've tasted from the first John Wick movie, then it
would be still enjoyable, but it’s too late to stop this ""cliche train” starting from John Wick

Blindman appears to feel where are distant people to shoot but he can not feel where is

supported by bad acting and bloated style that it would have been a much better
film just to leave it all out and just show a montage of fight sequences.

The Marquis character never shows the ability to do anything except sneer in an
outrageous French accent and surround himself with dumb lieutenants, The Bowery
King and the Harbinger characters are trotted out at the beginning and the end of

repetitive, tired and unimaginative, exploiting the action theme without really having a
coherent story. Everything ends up being absurd only with a good job in the fight
choreography. An overrated film, practically bad and with an excessive duration for the
null story it tells.

use 3 bullets (but sometimes they still stand).

As much as I enjoyed the very first John Wick movie as bored I felt during these
extremely long and uninteresting fighting scenes. He is as immortal as Iron Man and with
this leaves all excitement.

And it seems as if the directors were mocking the franchise by letting John fall out of the
4th floor, getting run over by cars, falling down literally 222 steps (I know because they
mention it) of a staircase and all of it just leads to some short heavy breathing but it's

The movie long climax scene grows old fast as John Wick now has unlimited stamina, can
almost never be shot, recovers from all injuries, and is now in God Mode. And as anyone

movie is a joke. If the protagonist is never in danger, and can never really be hurt,
there's no tension or drama. Don't waste your time.

actor . The set pieces of this movie was beautiful and again , the fights are well done but
this movie just felt long and pointless . At times I seen about 4 people asleep in the
theaters , then seen half of them pretty Much sleeping . One person puked from the
constant action this movie kept throwing at your face . If you like pointless fights with a
lot of violence , bad acting and terrible written characters , this movie fits right up your
alley! Just bring a blanket , a pillow and get ready for the greatest action nap of your life

159,"HORRIBLE movie. I love John Wick. I mean I wouldn't pay to see one, but I love
the series none the less. Even liked the third one even though the ending blew
baby chunks. All the 10s and 9s scores are so damn fake it's hilarious. IMDB is a
joke. Someone needs to start a real movie database and weed out the fake high
scores, it's as ridiculous as John Wick 4. He walks away from every major injury or
collision or building fall. Then he passes away from flesh wounds. What nonsense.
The whole plot is nonsense. The fights scene are so boring. I got up to make a
sandwich twice, Just the typical 100 judo throws and same shots to head.
Numerous coup de grace's. I feel sorry for anyone who paid for this nonsense.

160,"This movie is so bad that I stopped watching it inside the theater to write this review...

What happened here?!? I was so excited to see this movie and now I feel so let down. I
come to see ""John Wick"" films for the immaculate and creative fight choreography. Do
not walk into this movie expecting any of that. All the purism which caused the first three
films to shine is gone. The “John Wick"" franchise has completely disappeared up its own
a*s, This goofy underworld the movies created only worked when a normal world still
existed in the Wick Universe. But there is no ""real world"" anymore. Every single character
in this movie looks cartoonish, like a steampunk caricature of a real person. Even the
villains were painfully cartoonish, one of them even sporting a full mouth full of ridiculous
gold teeth. I couldn't even look at him without laughing.

161,"Those 3 movies were crafted together to create the 3 hour schemozzle that is John
Wick 4. This is what happens when new blood inherits a simple but wildly popular
character,

Over-compensation when out of ideas. Let's bring in so many characters we can't
keep up with them & bamboozle the optics with the visual delights of vogue cities;
Paris, NY & Tokyo.. This movie betrays everything that was right with the first
movie,

The fight scenes are straight from a 1986 arcade machine with bad guys lined up
patiently to take on our hero & he levels up through every robotic stoush.

The Warriors DJ was my breaking point. My 4th grade self would've loved this crap.
Keanu's better than this

162,"First of all I want to start by saying that this film, in any shape or form will satisfy you if
you're a die hard John Wick fan like me

It has caught my attention that the reviews for Chapter 4 has been nothing but high
scores and prasing reviews... (Even people saying that its the best chapter!) Sadly I
couldn't figure out exactly why.

The first and the biggest problem in my opinion is that the film includes close to none
character development. For me, a John Wick movie must, and I say this again, must
make you eager for the thought of John Wick taking his revenge from other villians.
However in this movie sadly all you get is unlimited bodies thrown at John and no sense
of that anger and fury.

Another problem is that the film is absurdly unrealistic, Of course we all know that John
Wick movies are supposed to be unrealistic to some degree but this one makes you want
to leave the theater... The cringe caused physical pain on my body.
",negative
163,"I normally don't write reviews but this movie just pushed the boundaries of absurdity so
far that I just can't say nothing!

We get it, John Wick never dies, OK!

But at least put a tiny bit of reason into the moviel! He jumps out of the window from the
third floor, lands on car, THE CAR'S ROOF GETS SMASHED!!!, but he just stands up and
continues fighting???

And some scenes are so ridiculous that the whole cinema was laughing. Like the scene
near the ending where he is literally just rolling himself down the staircase for no reason!
You can literally see him push his arms to the ground to roll one more stair flight down!

164,"Thaven't seen 1,2,3 so I don't know the whole story.
But I doubt it exists at all.

Actually it's not a movie, but a video game

The only difference is that we don't play, we just watch.
Technically work is spectacular.

Everything else is nothing.

And finally a relief.

John Wick is buried.

165,"The first 3 movies were fun. This one is so very bad and boring. I can not believe the
rating is so high. None of the first 3 movies deserved 10 but this one was so bad. Wasn
not fun, was not exciting, was not deep. It was nothing. I still have to write 350
characters but honestly there is nothing else to say. John wick 4 is a bad boring movie |
And I really hope this was the last one. There is obviously nothing else to do or show or
shoot or make. Keanu is a super nice guy and I like him so I hope the movie will make

enough cash. But it beyond my understanding how could some many people give it 10
points!

166,"like to watch people getting killed. Give me a movie where people are getting killed for
3 hours and T'll be happy. Then you've come to the right place in Hollywood. Hollywood is
for the mob what was once the arena in ancient Rome, but the light version, The rabble,
ignorant, feasting on big screens where violence is shown as necessary, tough and sexy.
John Wick is like American porn: do you like chocolate? Then we'll drown you in it. The
film has a total lack of drama, a total lack of imagination and, even worse, a total lack of
humour, After the umpteenth headshot I look bored at my lukewarm popcom. Kenau
Reeves, the Internet's darling of good deeds, plays a depressed killer in a black suit who
does nothing but kill people. A feast to watch for the poor in spirit. Hollywood: we've got
millions and what do we do? Portraying human ugliness like it is sexy.
",negative
167,"Just how much cash can you get out of a cash cow? As the John Wick producers know
that's plenty of dough but with each iteration the movies become ever more flabby and
contrived. The Hollywood formula has been employed; copy a previous success adding
ever more crash bang and wollop and of course stretching the whole thing out to a dreary
3 hour run time. But of course Hollywood misses the point, yet again. What made the
original Wick movie interesting was the character's struggle to make a new life only to be
dragged back into the criminal underworld. Granted it's an interesting and novel criminal
underworld but now it's the world of John Wick which is the focus, not Wick himself. Time
to call it a day.

168,"At least this once fine franchise now has a (meh) ending. Tired, stupid, annoying. Only 1
great gunfight (a GLORIOUS top down, exploding shotgun shells, massacre) & 1 good
hand-to-hand fight (with an unrecognisable #ScottAdkins), the rest of the action’s dull,
repetitive, silliness. #KeanuReeves (effective in the other 3 films) here gives a truly
appalling performance. He sounds like his batteries are running out,
every....word....is....emotionless. His opening scene might THE worst acting seen in
cinema history...& he only says ""Yeah""!

169,"There's no spoilers here at all.

But to those who gave classic 7 to 10 stars review rating are obviously “anything goes for
my popcorn” sort of audiences.

All I'm about to say is simple.
John Wick focuses around a man who wants to get out clean

But dragged back by force and circumstances, he is forced to avenge for the fact he can't
let go and to not be able to forgive and forget.

Forward to this very 4th installment, thinking it would surpass the ist, or yet the 2nd,
well at least the 3rd. But it fail miserably.

Miserably.
The fights are a mess versus the 3rd installment.

Meaningless action choreographed in its worst ever style of fights.

170,"I was greatly disappointed with #4. The story line was weak. If all you care about is
mindless fighting and shooting, you will be happy. I know that is the key element in this
story, but people still need a good story, and some actual acting. As it was released, it is
already quite long. So, I feel that they could have eliminated much of the ridiculous
fighting in the traffic circle of Paris and added more meat to the story. Too much of the
movie was incomplete. There could have been more for Lawrence Fishburne, And they
could have done more with Shamier Anderson. I understand that they wanted to close
out the series with John Wick's name restored. So, they could have done more, in the
latter half of the movie, with his efforts to restore his name. This movie just didn’t come
together for me. As it stands, I think John Wick should have died at the end of John Wick

171,"Oh dear. This was truly awful. I loved the first three but Keanu is laughably atrocious
whenever he opens his mouth in this one.

Cane had me laughing until I cried, I could just see the Family Guy parody that will surely
be in the works soon!

Nothing made sense.

Such a shame, they threw a load of money at this and forgot all about the plot and
characters.

The fight scenes were fantastic, especially the later scenes in Paris, but the heart of what
made the first John Wick a surprise hit was missing

The dog. The wife, It's all long forgotten at this point, and a 5 second flashback doesn't
help that.

172,"Exceptionally boring, there is nothing going on throughout the whole movie. 1 was
great, then it turned into James Bourne, he was merely running away, no story
whatsoever. I give it 3 because of great actors and the loyalty, otherwise I would
rate it as 1. The CGI dog flying over the cars was just the cherry on top.

Even if you do not know, how it ends, you can easily guess it, they introduced
some supposedly logical twist using their precious rules made up as they go, which

did not occur to them for the whole 3 movies before.

Twas looking forward to this movie, but it was a total disappointment.
",positive
173,"I never go see films on release day, but I thought id make an exception for this film as 1
enjoyed the previous three so much.

This was an incredibly slow film, there was a point about 20 mins in where I thought I
was really thirsty and needed a drink, so I went and bought one, came back and it was
still the same scene.

The enjoyment seems to have gone, it looked like in previous episodes they thought up
the craziest stunts they could - mass motorbike shoot outs, horses being chased by
motorbikes and all of these things happened at a relentless pace alll through the film
Now everyone's dressed in really fancy clothes, speaking in improbably bad accents and
in making strange pseudo mystical comments. Do they hire cheap actors to make the
budget work?

It's started to take it self way too seriously. You've seen all the choreographed moves
before and the blind guy is just not believable. The amazing sets and cinematography
with all the 'buke' backgrounds have all been done in the three previous films.
",negative
174,"I really liked the first 3. And really hated this one. I thought the action sequences
were stupid like one that reminded me of the scene in Hot Rod where Andy
Samberg goes flying down and a hill and doesn't stop for miles. Apparently this is
one of John Wick's new superpowers, to be able to survive long falls. The Scout
character is extra stupid and unnecessary. I don't understand his motivation.
There's too many characters here that are supposed to be important. I just found
everything confusing and redundant. There may have been one or two scenes that
I liked but J can't even think which they are. Keannu is too slow now to pull these
fight scenes off. Donnie reprises his role from Star Wars Rogue One. I just think it's
a messy movie.
